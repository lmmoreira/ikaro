# M13 — Dashboard Frontend (Staff, Manager, Customer, Guest)

**Phase:** Local Development
**Goal:** Staff have a functional command center to manage bookings, services, schedule, and loyalty. Managers additionally run team, settings, and hotsite administration. Customers have a portal to view bookings, loyalty, and switch tenants. Guests can respond to info requests via a standalone link. All pages connect to the local BFF and are protected by the JWT auth flow from M03.
**Depends on:** M02 (Platform context), M03 (auth/JWT), M04 (staff aggregate), M05 (service aggregate), M08 (booking backend), M09 (cancellation/reschedule backend), M10 (loyalty backend), M12 (hotsite frontend foundation), M115 (production readiness baseline)
**Blocks:** M16 (E2E tests cover dashboard flows)

## Supersession note

This file replaces six previously separate draft milestone files — `M124-LOGIN.md`, `M125-STAFF-DASHBOARD.md`, `M126-CUSTOMER-MINHA-CONTA.md`, `M127-MANAGER-WORKSPACE.md`, `M128-STAFF-LOYALTY.md`, `M129-GUEST-SUBMIT-INFO.md` — plus the original coarse-grained draft of this file. None of the 47 stories across those 7 files had been implemented. They have been consolidated here, renumbered into one dependency-ordered sequence, with one cross-milestone gap closed (`M13-S29`'s loyalty conversion-rate dependency) and a few small AC additions folded in where the journey-prototype audit found a concrete missing piece. Every story below carries a "(formerly M1xx-Sxx)" note for traceability back to the original drafts (recoverable via git history).

**Key reordering decision:** stories with zero frontend-shell dependency (pure backend or BFF work) are pulled into one early "Backend & BFF readiness" wave (Phase 1) regardless of which feature area they originally belonged to. This means no later frontend phase ever blocks waiting on a backend/BFF story that "belonged" to a milestone sequenced after it — the old M126/M128 split, for example, would have shipped the customer loyalty page before the conversion-rate field it displays existed; pulling both BFF stories forward removes that gap entirely instead of patching around it.

---

## Architecture & conventions (apply across every story below)

> Carried forward from the original M13 draft's "Key Architectural Notes" — these are cross-cutting decisions that apply to the whole milestone, not restated per story.

**Two separate API client layers — do not unify them:**
- `apps/web/lib/api/platform.ts` (built in M12-S03) — `fetch()`-based, unauthenticated, ISR-cached (`next: { revalidate: 300 }`), for the **public hotsite manifest**.
- `apps/web/lib/api/bff-client.ts` (built in `M13-S01` below) — Axios instance, JWT cookie + `X-Tenant-Slug` interceptors, client-side, TanStack Query, for the **authenticated dashboard**. Don't route the public hotsite fetch through this client (it would attach auth headers unnecessarily to a cacheable public request).

**TanStack Query conventions:**
- Every `queryKey` array includes `tenantId` (from JWT) to prevent cross-tenant cache pollution.
- `401` response → hook throws `AuthError` → middleware/page redirects to login.
- `403` response → hook throws `ForbiddenError` → page shows "Acesso negado" in pt-BR.
- `QueryClient` configured with `staleTime: 30000` (30s) and `retry: 1`.

**Role-based rendering:** CUSTOMER sees Agendamentos/Fidelidade/Trocar empresa; STAFF sees Agenda/Horários/Serviços/Fidelidade; MANAGER sees all STAFF items + Equipe/Configurações/Hotsite under a "Somente Gerente" sidebar section.

**Phone precondition for CUSTOMER (UC-021 A3):** after login/tenant-selection, a CUSTOMER with `phone === null` is prompted inline (bottom sheet) to complete it before proceeding. STAFF/MANAGER never see this.

**Multi-tenant support:** tenant selection happens at `/select-tenant` (2+ tenants at login); `TenantSwitcher`/`/switch-tenant` lets a logged-in customer change tenant context without re-doing OAuth.

**Booking form / calendar reuse:** the `AvailabilityCalendar` component built for the guest/customer booking flow (UC-011, M12) is reused for staff's reschedule action (`M13-S19`) — verify it's extracted in a way that doesn't pull in basket/duration-recompute logic specific to the booking flow.

**`dashboard-shell.html` CSS classes — do not invent new ones, use what's in `shared/tokens.css`:** `.dashboard-topbar`, `.topbar-page-title`, `.topbar-date`, `.dashboard-layout`, `.sidebar`, `.sidebar-header`, `.sidebar-nav`/`.sidebar-nav-item`/`.sidebar-nav-icon`, `.sidebar-section-label`, `.sidebar-footer`, `.main-content`, `.dashboard-body`, `.bottom-nav`, `.auth-avatar` (NOT `.topbar-avatar` — hidden on desktop), `.role-badge`/`.role-badge-manager`, `.status-badge` + `.status-*`.

## Phase 0 — Frontend foundation

### M13-S01 — TanStack Query setup + typed BFF client

*(formerly M13-S01)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` § state management + API client

**Description:**
Set up TanStack Query (React Query) as the global data-fetching layer and create typed client functions for every BFF endpoint. This is the foundation all dashboard pages build on — pages import typed hooks, not raw `fetch` calls.

> **Note (M12 follow-up):** `apps/web/lib/api/platform.ts` (M12-S03) already exists — it's a `fetch()`-based, unauthenticated, ISR-cached client for the **public hotsite manifest**. The `bff-client.ts` Axios instance planned here is for the **authenticated dashboard** (JWT cookie + `X-Tenant-Slug` headers, client-side, TanStack Query). Keep these separate — see "Architecture & conventions" above.

**What to create:**
- `apps/web/lib/api/bff-client.ts` — Axios instance with base URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BFF_URL`), JWT cookie interceptor (attach `Authorization` header), `X-Tenant-Slug` interceptor, error handling (RFC 9457 Problem Detail → typed `ApiError`)
- `apps/web/lib/api/` — typed function per endpoint group: `bookings.ts`, `services.ts`, `schedule.ts`, `loyalty.ts`, `staff.ts`, `tenants.ts`, `auth.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/hooks/` — TanStack Query wrappers:
  - `useBookings(filters)`, `useBooking(id)`, `useCreateBooking()`, `useUpdateBookingStatus()`
  - `useServices()`, `useCreateService()`, `useUpdateService()`
  - `useAvailability(date, serviceIds)`, `useScheduleClosures()`
  - `useLoyaltyBalance()`, `useLoyaltyEntries()`
  - `useStaff()`, `useInviteStaff()`, `useDeactivateStaff()`
  - `useTenantSettings()`, `useUpdateTenantSettings()`
  - `useHotsiteConfig()`, `useUpdateHotsiteConfig()`
- `apps/web/providers/query-provider.tsx` — wraps the app in `QueryClientProvider`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every BFF endpoint has a corresponding typed function in `lib/api/`
- [ ] All hooks use `queryKey` arrays that include `tenantId` (from JWT) to prevent cross-tenant cache pollution
- [ ] A `401` response from BFF → hook throws `AuthError` → middleware redirects to login
- [ ] A `403` response → hook throws `ForbiddenError` → page shows "Acesso negado" in pt-BR
- [ ] `QueryClient` is configured with `staleTime: 30000` (30s) and `retry: 1`
- [ ] TypeScript: all hook return types are fully typed (no `any`)

**Dependencies:** M00-S05, M03-S06

---

## Phase 1 — Backend & BFF readiness

> Every story in this phase has zero frontend-shell dependency — each depends only on an already-completed backend milestone (M02/M05/M08/M09/M10) or an earlier Phase-1 story. They can be built in any order relative to each other and in parallel with Phase 0; they exist here as one wave purely so Phase 3+ frontend work is never blocked waiting on missing data.

### M13-S02 — BFF: fix auth cookie on `POST /auth/token` + `POST /auth/switch-tenant`; fix customer redirect

*(formerly M124-S01)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-021 UC-023, `plan/M03-AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS_IA.md`
**Journey prototypes:** `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/login/` · `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/login/` — reviewed; UC audit done 2026-06-16

**Description:**
Three targeted fixes to `apps/bff/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`. No new endpoints, no schema changes — only behavioural corrections to existing methods. The BFF already has `JWT_COOKIE_OPTIONS` and `res.cookie(...)` usage in other handlers; replicate the same pattern.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Read `apps/bff/src/auth/auth.controller.ts` in full. Confirm the exact signature of `issueToken` and `switchTenant` (no `@Res()` param yet — must add `@Res({ passthrough: true })`). Read `apps/bff/src/auth/cookie-options.ts` to confirm the constant name. Check whether `@ikaro/types` currently exports a type for the `POST /auth/token` response — if yes, that type must be updated here. Run `grep -r "IssueToken\|issueToken" packages/types/` to check.

**Fix 1 — `POST /auth/token` (multi-tenant selection):**

Current:
```ts
async issueToken(@Body() dto: IssueTokenDto): Promise<{ accessToken: string; expiresIn: string }>
```

After fix — set cookie, return tenant slug for frontend redirect:
```ts
async issueToken(
  @Body() dto: IssueTokenDto,
  @Res({ passthrough: true }) res: Response,
): Promise<{ tenantSlug: string; expiresIn: string }> {
  // ... existing match + tenantInfo lookup (unchanged) ...
  const accessToken = this.jwtIssuer.issueToken({ sub: match.customerId, tenantId, tenantSlug, role: 'CUSTOMER' });
  res.cookie('access_token', accessToken, JWT_COOKIE_OPTIONS);
  return { tenantSlug: tenantInfo.slug, expiresIn: this.config.getOrThrow<string>('JWT_EXPIRES_IN') };
}
```

**Fix 2 — `POST /auth/switch-tenant`:**

Same pattern: add `@Res({ passthrough: true }) res: Response`, set cookie, return `{ tenantSlug: string; expiresIn: string }` instead of `{ accessToken, expiresIn }`.

**Fix 3 — customer post-login redirect:**

In `handleTenantLogin` and in the 1-tenant branch of `handleMultiTenantLogin`, change:
```ts
res.redirect(`${frontendUrl}/dashboard`);
```
to:
```ts
res.redirect(`${frontendUrl}/${tenantInfo.slug}`);
```

**`@ikaro/types` changes:**

Add or update `packages/types/src/auth.dto.ts` (create if absent):
```typescript
export interface IssueTokenResponse {
  readonly tenantSlug: string;
  readonly expiresIn: string;
}

export interface SwitchTenantResponse {
  readonly tenantSlug: string;
  readonly expiresIn: string;
}

export interface TenantOption {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly slug: string;
  readonly loyaltyPoints: number;   // current_points from loyalty_balances
}
```

`TenantOption` is consumed by the `/select-tenant` page (`M13-S14`). `IssueTokenResponse` and `SwitchTenantResponse` replace the old `{ accessToken, expiresIn }` shape — since neither endpoint has a frontend consumer yet (those pages are built in `M13-S13`/`M13-S14`), this is a safe breaking change.

**Tests to update:**

- `apps/bff/src/auth/auth.controller.spec.ts` — update assertions for `issueToken` and `switchTenant`: verify `res.cookie` is called with `'access_token'`, verify returned shape is `{ tenantSlug, expiresIn }`, verify `accessToken` is no longer in the response
- `apps/bff/src/auth/auth.controller.component.spec.ts` — update the `POST /auth/token` and `POST /auth/switch-tenant` integration assertions; add assertions that `Set-Cookie` header is present; add assertion that `handleTenantLogin` redirects to `/${tenantSlug}` not `/dashboard`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `POST /auth/token` response body: `{ tenantSlug: string; expiresIn: string }` — no `accessToken` field
- [ ] `POST /auth/token` sets `access_token` httpOnly cookie (same options as other handlers)
- [ ] `POST /auth/switch-tenant` response body: `{ tenantSlug: string; expiresIn: string }` — no `accessToken` field
- [ ] `POST /auth/switch-tenant` sets `access_token` httpOnly cookie
- [ ] `GET /auth/google/callback` for a tenant-scoped customer login redirects to `${frontendUrl}/${tenantSlug}`, not `/dashboard`
- [ ] `GET /auth/google/callback` for multi-tenant customer (auto-selected 1 tenant) redirects to `${frontendUrl}/${tenantSlug}`
- [ ] Staff login redirect unchanged: still redirects to `${frontendUrl}/dashboard`
- [ ] `IssueTokenResponse`, `SwitchTenantResponse`, `TenantOption` exported from `@ikaro/types`
- [ ] `.http` block in `apps/bff/http/auth/auth.http` reflects updated response shape
- [ ] All existing auth controller tests pass; no new TypeScript errors

**Dependencies:** none — first story in Phase 1

### M13-S03 — BFF: staff booking list endpoint

*(formerly M125-S02)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md` § Bookings, `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Description:**
Provide a paginated, filterable booking list endpoint shaped for the booking queue UI. The queue shows a summary card per booking — customer name, services, scheduled time, status badge, total price.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Open `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts`. There is likely a `GET /v1/bookings` route already (built in M08/M09 for customer-side listing). Read its current shape, query params, and `@Roles` decorator. If it already returns a staff-friendly shape (customer name, service names, status), this story may reduce to adding/adjusting query params only. If it returns a customer-shaped response (own bookings only), a new dedicated staff variant is needed.

**Proposed endpoint (adjust based on discovery):**

> **Queue grouping resolved 2026-06-16** (see `plan/journey/staff/agenda.md` "Queue scope"): the queue is grouped by urgency, not date — "Precisa de ação" (no date filter, ALL pending/info-requested), "Hoje" (approved, today only), "Próximos dias" (approved, future). One endpoint shape serves all three via different query params — no separate routes needed.

```
GET /v1/bookings
Headers: X-Actor-Role: STAFF | MANAGER, X-Tenant-ID: {tenantId}
Query params:
  status?   comma-separated BookingStatus values (default: PENDING,INFO_REQUESTED)
  date?     YYYY-MM-DD — exact-date filter, used for "Hoje" (status=APPROVED&date=today)
  from?     YYYY-MM-DD — range-start filter, used for "Próximos dias" (status=APPROVED&from=tomorrow)
  page?     integer (default: 1)
  limit?    integer (default: 20, max: 100)
```

`date` and `from` are mutually exclusive — "Precisa de ação" sends neither (no date filter at all, sorted by `scheduledAt ASC` regardless of day).

Response shape (new type `StaffBookingCardResponse` in `@ikaro/types`):
```typescript
interface StaffBookingCardResponse {
  bookingId: string;
  status: BookingStatus;
  scheduledAt: string;           // ISO-8601
  contactName: string;           // guest name or customer name
  serviceNames: string[];        // one per line, e.g. ["Lavagem Simples", "Enceramento"]
  totalPrice: MoneyAmount;
  totalDurationMins: number;
  isCustomer: boolean;           // true = authenticated customer; false = guest
}

interface StaffBookingListResponse {
  items: StaffBookingCardResponse[];
  total: number;
  page: number;
  limit: number;
}
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings?status=PENDING,INFO_REQUESTED` (no date) returns ALL matching bookings regardless of date, sorted by `scheduledAt ASC`, scoped to tenant
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings?status=APPROVED&date=2026-06-16` returns only that exact date's approved bookings
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings?status=APPROVED&from=2026-06-17` returns approved bookings on/after that date
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings` with CUSTOMER JWT → `403`
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings` without auth → `401`
- [ ] Tenant isolation: Tenant A's MANAGER cannot retrieve Tenant B's bookings
- [ ] Empty result → `{ items: [], total: 0, page: 1, limit: 20 }` (not 404)
- [ ] `StaffBookingCardResponse` and `StaffBookingListResponse` added to `packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`
- [ ] `.http` request block added to `apps/bff/http/bookings/bookings.http`

**Dependencies:** M08

### M13-S04 — BFF: booking detail endpoint for staff

*(formerly M125-S04)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md` § Bookings + Loyalty, `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-003

**Description:**
Provide the full booking detail, enriched with the customer's loyalty balance. UC-003 step 1 explicitly says "The dashboard shows the customer's current active-points balance so the admin can decide." This requires BFF orchestration: backend booking detail + loyalty balance lookup.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Open `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` and look for `GET /v1/bookings/:id`. It likely exists from M08. Check: (a) whether it already includes `loyaltyBalance`, (b) its `@Roles` guard — does it allow STAFF|MANAGER, or is it customer-only? If it serves both actors, the staff enrichment (loyalty balance) might need to be conditional on role. Verify `GET /v1/loyalty/:customerId/balance` or equivalent exists in the BFF from M10.

**Proposed endpoint (adjust based on discovery):**

```
GET /v1/bookings/:id
Headers: X-Actor-Role: STAFF | MANAGER, X-Tenant-ID, X-Actor-ID
```

Staff-shaped response type `StaffBookingDetailResponse` (add to `packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`):
```typescript
interface StaffBookingDetailResponse {
  bookingId: string;
  status: BookingStatus;
  scheduledAt: string;
  type: 'GUEST' | 'CUSTOMER';

  // Contact / customer info
  contactName: string;
  contactEmail: string;
  contactPhone: string;
  contactAddress: Address | null;
  pickupAddress: Address | null;

  // Loyalty (null for guest bookings)
  customerId: string | null;
  loyaltyBalance: number | null;     // current active points
  loyaltyConversionRate: number;     // points_per_currency_unit (added in M13-S12 — see M13-S26's note)

  // Lines
  lines: StaffBookingLineResponse[];
  totalPrice: MoneyAmount;
  totalDurationMins: number;

  // Media
  beforeServicePhotoUrls: string[];   // signed read URLs

  // Admin-recorded fields
  infoRequestMessage: string | null;  // UC-005: what admin asked
  infoResponseMessage: string | null; // UC-005 A2: what customer answered
  approvedAt: string | null;
  approvedBy: string | null;          // staffId UUID
  rejectionReason: string | null;
}

interface StaffBookingLineResponse {
  lineId: string;
  serviceName: string;
  priceAtBooking: MoneyAmount;
  durationMinsAtBooking: number;
  pointsValueAtBooking: number;
  requiresPickupAddressAtBooking: boolean;
}
```

> **Note (added during consolidation):** `loyaltyConversionRate` is listed here so `M13-S26` (loyalty redemption strip in Mark Complete) doesn't need a second BFF call on mount. It depends on `M13-S12` having landed (which adds `points_per_currency_unit` enrichment) — since `M13-S12` is also in Phase 1, this is satisfied by construction regardless of which order M13-S04/M13-S12 land in within the phase. If `M13-S04` is implemented before `M13-S12`, add the field as a follow-up patch rather than blocking.

**BFF orchestration:**

When `customerId != null`:
1. `GET /bookings/:id` → backend booking detail
2. `GET /loyalty/balance?customerId=:customerId` (or equivalent loyalty endpoint) → `{ currentPoints }`
3. Compose response with `loyaltyBalance = currentPoints`

When `customerId == null` (guest booking): skip loyalty call, return `loyaltyBalance: null`.

Before-service photo URLs: call `IStorageService.getSignedReadUrl(path)` per photo path (same pattern as M115-S01). Or pass filePaths to frontend and have Next.js image proxy — decide at discovery.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings/:id` with STAFF|MANAGER JWT returns `StaffBookingDetailResponse`
- [ ] `loyaltyBalance` is populated for customer bookings; `null` for guest bookings
- [ ] `infoRequestMessage` populated when booking is INFO_REQUESTED or beyond
- [ ] `infoResponseMessage` populated when customer submitted info (UC-005 A2)
- [ ] CUSTOMER JWT → `403` (staff-only endpoint)
- [ ] Booking not in tenant → `404`
- [ ] Tenant isolation: MANAGER of Tenant A cannot retrieve Tenant B's booking detail
- [ ] `StaffBookingDetailResponse` + `StaffBookingLineResponse` in `packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`
- [ ] `.http` block added/updated in `apps/bff/http/bookings/bookings.http`

**Dependencies:** M08, M10 (loyalty balance endpoint)

---

### M13-S05 — BFF: staff service management endpoints

*(formerly M125-S07)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md` § Services, `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-012, UC-013

**Description:**
Verify and fill the BFF surface for staff service management. `POST /v1/services`, `PATCH /v1/services/:id`, and `DELETE /v1/services/:id` were implemented in M05 — this story confirms they exist and adds any missing pieces: a staff-authenticated list endpoint that returns **inactive** services (the public hotsite endpoint only returns `isActive: true`), and a single-service fetch for edit pre-fill.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Open `apps/bff/src/` and locate the services module (likely `platform/` or `catalog/`). Check: (a) does `GET /v1/services` already exist with a STAFF|MANAGER guard? Does it return `isActive`? (b) does `GET /v1/services/:id` exist for authenticated staff? (c) do `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` endpoints exist with correct `@Roles('STAFF','MANAGER')` guard and `.http` blocks? List every gap — this story fills all of them.
>
> ⚠️ **Backend gap, not just BFF:** `CreateServiceRequest.isActive` below has no backing capability today — `Service.create()` in `apps/backend/src/contexts/booking/domain/service.aggregate.ts` hardcodes `isActive: true` with no override parameter, and `CreateServiceSchema` has no `isActive` field. Passing `isActive: false` through the BFF will not work until the backend's `Service.create()` and DTO/schema are extended to accept it — this is a backend-side change, out of scope for this BFF-only story unless explicitly pulled in.

**Endpoints to verify or add:**

```
GET    /v1/services          X-Actor-Role: STAFF|MANAGER   → StaffServiceListResponse
GET    /v1/services/:id      X-Actor-Role: STAFF|MANAGER   → StaffServiceResponse
POST   /v1/services          X-Actor-Role: STAFF|MANAGER   → StaffServiceResponse   (likely already exists)
PATCH  /v1/services/:id      X-Actor-Role: STAFF|MANAGER   → StaffServiceResponse   (likely already exists)
DELETE /v1/services/:id      X-Actor-Role: STAFF|MANAGER   → 204                    (likely already exists)
```

**`@ikaro/types` additions (new file `packages/types/src/service.dto.ts` or extend existing):**

```typescript
export interface StaffServiceResponse {
  serviceId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string | null;
  price: MoneyAmount;
  durationMins: number;
  loyaltyPointsValue: number;
  requiresPickupAddress: boolean;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
}

export interface StaffServiceListResponse {
  items: StaffServiceResponse[];
  total: number;
}

export interface CreateServiceRequest {
  name: string;                   // max 100 chars, required
  description?: string;           // max 500 chars
  priceAmountCents: number;       // integer, > 0
  durationMins: number;           // integer, > 0
  loyaltyPointsValue?: number;    // integer, ≥ 0, default 0
  requiresPickupAddress?: boolean; // default false
  isActive?: boolean;             // default true
}

export interface UpdateServiceRequest {
  name?: string;
  description?: string;
  priceAmountCents?: number;
  durationMins?: number;
  loyaltyPointsValue?: number;
  requiresPickupAddress?: boolean;
}
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/services` with STAFF|MANAGER returns all services including `isActive: false` ones, scoped to tenant
- [ ] `GET /v1/services` with CUSTOMER JWT → `403`; without auth → `401`
- [ ] `GET /v1/services/:id` with STAFF|MANAGER returns single service (active or inactive)
- [ ] `POST /v1/services` with duplicate name → `409` with RFC 9457 body
- [ ] `DELETE /v1/services/:id` → `204`; subsequent `GET /v1/services/:id` returns `isActive: false`
- [ ] Tenant isolation: MANAGER of Tenant A cannot read/modify Tenant B's services
- [ ] `.http` blocks present in `apps/bff/http/services/` for all 5 operations
- [ ] All types added to `@ikaro/types` and re-exported from `packages/types/src/index.ts`
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes across monorepo

**Dependencies:** M05 (Service aggregate + backend endpoints)

### M13-S06 — BFF: customer booking list + loyalty balance endpoints

*(formerly M126-S02)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md` § Bookings + Loyalty, `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Description:**
Provide the two data endpoints needed for the Minha Conta list page: a customer-scoped booking list and the loyalty balance strip.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Open `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts`. Look for `GET /v1/bookings`. Check: (a) does it already allow `CUSTOMER` role via `@Roles`? (b) when called with a CUSTOMER JWT, does it filter to `customerId === JWT.sub`? (c) does its response shape include `status`, `scheduledAt`, `lines[].serviceName`, `lines[].priceAtBooking`, `totalPrice`, and `booking.notes`? If yes to all three, this story reduces to adding `CustomerBookingListResponse` to `packages/types/` only.
> - Open `apps/bff/src/loyalty/loyalty.controller.ts` (or similar). Check if `GET /v1/loyalty/balance` exists and is accessible to CUSTOMER role. Response should include `currentPoints`, `nextExpiryDate`, `nextExpiryPoints`.

**`@ikaro/types` additions** (`packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`):
```typescript
export interface CustomerBookingLineItem {
  lineId: string;
  serviceName: string;
  durationMins: number;
  priceAtBooking: MoneyAmount;
}

export interface CustomerBookingListItem {
  bookingId: string;
  status: BookingStatus;
  scheduledAt: string | null;     // ISO-8601; null when PENDING with no slot yet
  lines: CustomerBookingLineItem[];
  totalPrice: MoneyAmount;
  notes: string | null;           // booking.notes — what the customer wrote on request
}

export interface CustomerBookingListResponse {
  items: CustomerBookingListItem[];
  total: number;
}
```

**`@ikaro/types` additions** (`packages/types/src/loyalty.dto.ts` — extend if exists):
```typescript
export interface CustomerLoyaltyBalanceResponse {
  currentPoints: number;
  nextExpiryDate: string | null;   // ISO-8601 date
  nextExpiryPoints: number | null;
  conversionRate: number;          // points_per_currency_unit — see M13-S12; 0 = redemption disabled
}
```

**BFF changes (only if not already correct):**
- `GET /v1/bookings` — ensure `@Roles('CUSTOMER')` is included and the handler filters `WHERE customerId = X-Actor-ID AND tenantId = X-Tenant-ID`
- `GET /v1/loyalty/balance` — ensure `@Roles('CUSTOMER')` included; returns `CustomerLoyaltyBalanceResponse` shape

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings` with CUSTOMER JWT returns only that customer's bookings for the tenant
- [ ] Response items include `status`, `scheduledAt`, `lines`, `totalPrice`, `notes`
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings` with STAFF JWT → still works (no regression to `M13-S03`)
- [ ] `GET /v1/loyalty/balance` with CUSTOMER JWT → `CustomerLoyaltyBalanceResponse`, including `conversionRate` (see `M13-S12`; if `M13-S12` hasn't landed yet within Phase 1, default to `0` and patch when it does)
- [ ] Tenant isolation: Customer A cannot retrieve Customer B's bookings
- [ ] `CustomerBookingListResponse`, `CustomerBookingListItem`, `CustomerLoyaltyBalanceResponse` in `packages/types/`
- [ ] `.http` request blocks added/updated in `apps/bff/http/bookings/bookings.http` and `apps/bff/http/loyalty/loyalty.http`

**Dependencies:** M08 (booking list backend), M10 (loyalty balance backend)

### M13-S07 — BFF: customer booking detail endpoint

*(formerly M126-S04)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md` § Bookings, `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Description:**
Provide the full booking detail for a customer viewing their own booking. Ownership is mandatory: a CUSTOMER may only fetch bookings where `customerId === JWT.sub`.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Open `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts`. Find `GET /v1/bookings/:id`. Check: (a) does it allow `CUSTOMER` role? (b) does it enforce `customerId === X-Actor-ID`, returning `403` otherwise? (c) does its response shape include `status`, `scheduledAt`, `lines`, `totalPrice`, `notes`, `infoRequestMessage`, `infoResponseMessage`? If yes to all three, this story is types-only.

**`@ikaro/types` additions** (`packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`):
```typescript
export interface CustomerBookingDetailResponse {
  bookingId: string;
  status: BookingStatus;
  scheduledAt: string | null;
  lines: CustomerBookingLineItem[];   // reuse from M13-S06
  totalPrice: MoneyAmount;
  notes: string | null;               // customer's own notes at time of request

  // UC-005 A2 — present when status is INFO_REQUESTED or beyond
  infoRequestMessage: string | null;  // what the admin asked
  infoResponseMessage: string | null; // what the customer already answered (if any)

  // Photos — empty array if none
  beforeServicePhotoUrls: string[];   // signed read URLs (BFF generates)
  afterServicePhotoUrls: string[];    // populated only when COMPLETED
}
```

**BFF changes (only if not already correct):**
- `GET /v1/bookings/:id` — ensure `@Roles('CUSTOMER')` allowed and `customerId === X-Actor-ID` enforced (403 if not the owner)
- Before-service/after-service photo URLs: call `IStorageService.getSignedReadUrl()` per path (same pattern as M115-S01)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings/:id` with CUSTOMER JWT (owner) → `200 CustomerBookingDetailResponse`
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings/:id` with CUSTOMER JWT (not the owner) → `403`
- [ ] `GET /v1/bookings/:id` with STAFF JWT → `200` (no regression to `M13-S04`)
- [ ] `infoRequestMessage` populated when booking is INFO_REQUESTED or beyond
- [ ] `afterServicePhotoUrls` non-empty only when `status === COMPLETED`
- [ ] Tenant isolation: `customerId` from Tenant A cannot retrieve Tenant B's bookings
- [ ] `CustomerBookingDetailResponse` in `packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`
- [ ] `.http` block added/updated in `apps/bff/http/bookings/bookings.http`

**Dependencies:** M08 (booking detail backend), M115-S01 (signed URL pattern)

### M13-S08 — BFF: customer loyalty entries + redemptions

*(formerly M126-S06)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md` § Loyalty, `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `plan/M10-COMPLETION-LOYALTY_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS_IA.md`

**Description:**
Provide the two paginated endpoints needed for the customer's full loyalty history page: earning entries and redemptions scoped to the authenticated customer.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Open `apps/bff/src/loyalty/` (or check where loyalty BFF routes live). Find `GET /v1/loyalty/entries` and `GET /v1/loyalty/redemptions`. Check: (a) do they exist? (b) do they include `@Roles('CUSTOMER')`? (c) do they filter results to `customerId === X-Actor-ID`?
> - If both exist and are CUSTOMER-scoped, this story is types-only.
> - Check `packages/types/src/loyalty.dto.ts` for existing `LoyaltyEntryResponse` and `LoyaltyRedemptionResponse` types. If present, verify shape matches what the BFF actually returns.

**`@ikaro/types` additions** (`packages/types/src/loyalty.dto.ts`):
```typescript
export interface CustomerLoyaltyEntryResponse {
  entryId: string;
  serviceName: string;
  pointsEarned: number;
  earnedAt: string;         // ISO-8601
  expiresAt: string | null; // ISO-8601; null = no expiry
  expired: boolean;         // server-computed: expiresAt != null && expiresAt < now
}

export interface CustomerLoyaltyEntriesResponse {
  items: CustomerLoyaltyEntryResponse[];
  total: number;
}

export interface CustomerLoyaltyRedemptionResponse {
  redemptionId: string;
  pointsUsed: number;
  amountSaved: string;       // formatted BRL e.g. "R$ 8,50"
  redeemedAt: string;        // ISO-8601
  bookingReference: string | null; // e.g. "Lavagem Completa" — from booking.lines
}

export interface CustomerLoyaltyRedemptionsResponse {
  items: CustomerLoyaltyRedemptionResponse[];
  total: number;
}
```

**BFF changes (only if not already correct):**
- `GET /v1/loyalty/entries` — ensure `@Roles('CUSTOMER')` included; filter `WHERE customerId = X-Actor-ID`; support `?limit=&offset=` for pagination (MVP default: `limit=50`)
- `GET /v1/loyalty/redemptions` — same role + ownership requirements

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/loyalty/entries` with CUSTOMER JWT → only that customer's entries for the tenant
- [ ] `GET /v1/loyalty/redemptions` with CUSTOMER JWT → only that customer's redemptions
- [ ] Entries include `expired: true` when `expiresAt < now`
- [ ] Tenant isolation: Customer A cannot retrieve Customer B's entries
- [ ] STAFF JWT on these endpoints still works (no regression to `M13-S12`)
- [ ] Types in `packages/types/`
- [ ] `.http` blocks updated in `apps/bff/http/loyalty/loyalty.http`

**Dependencies:** M10 (loyalty entries + redemptions backend)

### M13-S09 — Backend: add `GET /tenants/settings`

*(formerly M127-S01)*

**Agent:** `backend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/21-TENANTS_SETTINGS_SCHEMA.md`, `docs/02-DOMAIN_MODEL.md` (Tenant aggregate), `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-026

**Description:**
Add a read endpoint for tenant settings. Today the only way to read `tenants.settings` is the internal `GET /internal/tenants/:tenantId` route (gated by `InternalApiGuard` + `X-Internal-Key` — wrong audience for a `MANAGER`-authenticated dashboard request). This story adds a tenant-scoped, `MANAGER`-guarded GET mirroring the existing `PATCH`'s shape, so the settings form has something to load before editing.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Read `apps/backend/src/contexts/platform/infrastructure/controllers/tenant-settings.controller.ts` in full. Confirm the exact guard class used by `PATCH` (expected: `ManagerRoleGuard`) and which repository/use case it calls — the new GET use case should reuse the same repository load, not duplicate mapping logic. Check whether the repository already exposes a `findById`/`findByTenantId` that returns the full `TenantSettingsProps` VO; if so this story is a thin read wrapper, not new persistence code.

**What to create:**
- New use case `GetTenantSettingsUseCase` (application layer) → `{ tenantId, name, slug, settings: TenantSettingsProps }`
- New route on `tenant-settings.controller.ts`: `GET tenants/settings`, `@UseGuards(ManagerRoleGuard)`, scoped via `TenantContext` (not `X-Internal-Key`)
- `.http` request block in `apps/backend/http/platform/tenant-settings.http`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /tenants/settings` with `MANAGER` role returns `{ tenantId, name, slug, settings }` — `settings` fields stay snake_case, matching `PATCH`'s existing shape exactly
- [ ] `STAFF` role → `403`
- [ ] No auth → `401`
- [ ] Tenant isolation: returns only the requesting tenant's settings (dedicated integration test, per CLAUDE.md §7)
- [ ] Unit + integration test for the new use case
- [ ] `.http` block added in the same commit

**Dependencies:** M02

### M13-S10 — BFF: proxy `GET`/`PATCH /tenants/settings` (camelCase translation layer)

*(formerly M127-S02)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md`

**Description:**
Add the BFF module surface that doesn't exist today. The backend speaks snake_case (`cancellation_window_hours`, `business_hours.monday`, …); everything `apps/web` consumes elsewhere speaks camelCase (per the existing read-only `TenantSettings` interface in `packages/types/src/tenant.dto.ts`). This story is the translation layer, plus the write DTO that doesn't exist yet — `tenant.dto.ts` currently has no update/write shape at all.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Read `packages/types/src/tenant.dto.ts` in full and confirm the exact field names/nesting of the existing camelCase `TenantSettings` read interface **before** defining `UpdateTenantSettingsRequest` — the write shape must mirror the read shape field-for-field, not invent new names. Read `apps/bff/src/platform/hotsite-admin.controller.ts` and `platform.module.ts` to copy the exact registration pattern for a new controller in the same module (per CLAUDE.md's BFF naming rule — this belongs in the `platform` module, not a new one).

**What to create:**

`apps/bff/src/platform/tenant-settings.controller.ts`:
```
GET   tenants/settings   @Roles('MANAGER')  -> calls backend GET, maps snake_case -> camelCase, returns TenantSettingsResponse
PATCH tenants/settings   @Roles('MANAGER')  -> validates UpdateTenantSettingsRequest (Zod, camelCase), maps camelCase -> snake_case, calls backend PATCH, maps response back to camelCase
```

Register the controller in `apps/bff/src/platform/platform.module.ts` alongside `HotsiteAdminController`.

`packages/types/src/tenant.dto.ts` additions:
```typescript
export interface TenantSettingsResponse extends TenantSettings {
  tenantId: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
}

export interface UpdateTenantSettingsRequest {
  name?: string;
  cancellationWindowHours?: number;
  serviceBufferMinutes?: number;
  loyaltyExpiryDays?: number;
  businessHours?: {
    timezone: string;
    monday?: { open: string; close: string } | null;
    tuesday?: { open: string; close: string } | null;
    wednesday?: { open: string; close: string } | null;
    thursday?: { open: string; close: string } | null;
    friday?: { open: string; close: string } | null;
    saturday?: { open: string; close: string } | null;
    sunday?: { open: string; close: string } | null;
  };
  businessInfo?: {
    phone?: string | null;
    email?: string | null;
    address?: {
      street: string; number: string; complement?: string;
      neighborhood: string; city: string; state: string; zipCode: string;
    } | null;
  };
}
```

`.http` blocks in `apps/bff/http/platform/tenant-settings.http`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /tenants/settings` (BFF) returns camelCase fields matching `TenantSettingsResponse` exactly
- [ ] `PATCH /tenants/settings` (BFF) accepts a camelCase body and correctly maps every field — including nested per-day `businessHours` objects — to the backend's snake_case DTO
- [ ] `STAFF` JWT → `403`; no auth → `401`
- [ ] Backend `422` (invalid field) is forwarded as an RFC 9457 Problem Detail, not swallowed or remapped to a generic 500
- [ ] Round-trip integration test: `PATCH` a field, then `GET`, confirms the persisted value comes back correctly mapped
- [ ] `.http` blocks added for both routes
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes across the monorepo (the `packages/types` change touches multiple consumers)

**Dependencies:** M13-S09

### M13-S11 — Backend: `points_per_currency_unit` + `discountByPoints` in booking completion

*(formerly M128-S01)*

**Agent:** `backend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/21-TENANTS_SETTINGS_SCHEMA.md` §1, `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-009 A6, `docs/ENGINEERING_RULES.md`, `plan/M10-COMPLETION-LOYALTY_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS_IA.md`

**Description:**
Three targeted additions across two bounded contexts. No new use cases — all changes are extensions of existing ones.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Read `apps/backend/src/contexts/platform/domain/value-objects/tenant-settings.vo.ts` in full — confirm `LoyaltySettings` interface and Zod schema location.
> - Read `apps/backend/src/contexts/booking/application/dtos/complete-booking.dto.ts` and `apps/backend/src/contexts/booking/domain/booking.aggregate.ts` `complete()` method — understand how `totalActualPrice` is currently computed.
> - Read `apps/backend/src/contexts/loyalty/infrastructure/events/booking-completed.handler.ts` — understand the existing earning entry flow before extending it.
> - Verify `RecordRedemptionUseCase` exists in `apps/backend/src/contexts/loyalty/application/use-cases/` — confirm its DTO shape (`customerId`, `pointsToRedeem`, `bookingId?`, `notes?`).

> **Architecture decision — redemption via event (not BFF orchestration):** The redemption is triggered by the existing `BookingCompleted` domain event, not by the BFF calling `POST /v1/loyalty/redeem` as a second HTTP call. The loyalty `BookingCompletedHandler` is extended to check `event.data.discountByPoints` — if present, it calls `RecordRedemptionUseCase` after recording earning entries. This keeps the BFF thin (one call: `PATCH /complete`) and the redemption idempotent (dedup via `eventId` in `processed_events`). The BFF's `POST /v1/loyalty/redeem` route remains for future use cases (standalone manual redemption).

---

#### Part A — `points_per_currency_unit` in `TenantSettingsVO`

**File:** `apps/backend/src/contexts/platform/domain/value-objects/tenant-settings.vo.ts`

Add to `LoyaltySettings` interface:
```typescript
points_per_currency_unit: number; // 0 = redemption disabled; e.g. 10 = 10 pts → 1 currency unit
```

Add to the Zod loyalty schema:
```typescript
points_per_currency_unit: z.number().int().min(0).max(10000).default(0),
```

Add to `TenantSettingsDefaults.loyalty`:
```typescript
points_per_currency_unit: 0,
```

**Tests:** Update `apps/backend/src/contexts/platform/domain/value-objects/tenant-settings.spec.ts` — add cases: valid `points_per_currency_unit = 10`, zero (disabled), boundary 10000, reject negative, reject > 10000.

---

#### Part B — `discountByPoints` in `CompleteBookingDto` + `Booking.complete()`

**File:** `apps/backend/src/contexts/booking/application/dtos/complete-booking.dto.ts`

Add optional field to `CompleteBookingBodySchema`:
```typescript
discountByPoints: z
  .object({
    pointsUsed: z.number().int().positive(),
    amountDeducted: z.number().positive(),
  })
  .optional(),
```

Add to `CompleteBookingDto`:
```typescript
discountByPoints?: { pointsUsed: number; amountDeducted: number };
```

**Validation in use case** (`CompleteBookingUseCase`):
- If `dto.discountByPoints` is present AND `booking.customerId` is null → throw `LoyaltyRedemptionNotAvailableError` (guest bookings cannot redeem points)
- If `dto.discountByPoints` is present AND `settings.loyalty.points_per_currency_unit === 0` → throw `LoyaltyRedemptionDisabledError`
- Cap check: `pointsUsed <= currentBalance` is enforced by `RecordRedemptionUseCase` (loyalty context) — do not duplicate here
- `amountDeducted` must equal `Math.floor(pointsUsed / points_per_currency_unit)` within ±0.01 — reject if mismatch to prevent frontend manipulation

**`Booking.complete()` signature update** (`booking.aggregate.ts`):
```typescript
complete(
  completedBy: string,
  lines: { lineId: string; actualPriceCharged: number }[],
  afterServicePhotoUrls: string[],
  adminNotes?: string,
  discountByPoints?: { pointsUsed: number; amountDeducted: number },
): void
```

`totalActualPrice` calculation:
```typescript
const linesTotal = lines.reduce((sum, l) => sum + l.actualPriceCharged, 0);
const discount = discountByPoints?.amountDeducted ?? 0;
this.props.totalActualPrice = linesTotal - discount; // cannot go below 0
```

---

#### Part C — `discountByPoints` in `BookingCompleted` event + loyalty handler extension

**File:** `apps/backend/src/contexts/booking/domain/events/booking-completed.event.ts`

Add to `BookingCompletedData`:
```typescript
discountByPoints?: { pointsUsed: number; amountDeducted: number };
```

The `Booking.complete()` method already publishes `BookingCompleted` — update it to include `discountByPoints` in the event data when present.

**File:** `apps/backend/src/contexts/loyalty/infrastructure/events/booking-completed.handler.ts`

After `await this.recordLoyaltyEntries.execute(...)`, add:
```typescript
if (event.data.discountByPoints && event.data.customerId) {
  await this.recordRedemption.execute({
    tenantId: event.tenantId,
    eventId: event.eventId + '-redemption', // sub-key to keep idempotency key unique
    correlationId: event.correlationId,
    customerId: event.data.customerId,
    pointsToRedeem: event.data.discountByPoints.pointsUsed,
    bookingId: event.data.bookingId,
    notes: `Desconto na conclusão do agendamento`,
  });
}
```

Inject `RecordRedemptionUseCase` into the handler (add to `LoyaltyModule` providers and the handler's constructor).

> **Idempotency note:** `eventId + '-redemption'` is stored in `processed_events` separately from the earning-entry pass (`eventId` alone). This ensures a nack/retry of the full handler doesn't re-record the earning entries but also doesn't skip the redemption.

---

**HTTP file** (`apps/backend/http/booking/bookings.http`):
Update the `PATCH /bookings/:id/complete` request block to include an example with `discountByPoints`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `TenantSettingsVO` accepts and validates `loyalty.points_per_currency_unit` (0–10000, default 0)
- [ ] `PATCH /bookings/:id/complete` with `discountByPoints` → `totalActualPrice = linesTotal - amountDeducted`
- [ ] `PATCH /bookings/:id/complete` with `discountByPoints` on a guest booking → `422` with `loyalty-redemption-not-available`
- [ ] `PATCH /bookings/:id/complete` when `points_per_currency_unit = 0` → `422` with `loyalty-redemption-disabled`
- [ ] `BookingCompleted` event carries `discountByPoints` when present
- [ ] `BookingCompletedHandler` in loyalty context calls `RecordRedemptionUseCase` when `discountByPoints` is in event
- [ ] Redemption is idempotent — replaying the event does not create duplicate redemption
- [ ] Unit tests for `Booking.complete()` with and without `discountByPoints`
- [ ] Integration test: complete booking with discount → loyalty balance decremented by `pointsUsed`
- [ ] Integration test: tenant isolation — cannot apply discount to another tenant's customer

**Dependencies:** M10

### M13-S12 — BFF: customer search + balance enrichment + complete body update

*(formerly M128-S02)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md`

**Description:**
Three additions to the BFF: a new staff-facing customer search endpoint, enriching the loyalty balance response with the conversion rate, and forwarding `discountByPoints` through the booking completion body. Also fixes the stale `@ikaro/types` loyalty shapes.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Read `apps/bff/src/customers/customers.controller.ts` — confirm there is no `STAFF|MANAGER`-accessible GET route yet. The only routes are `GET /me` and `PATCH /me` (CUSTOMER-only).
> - Check `apps/backend/src/contexts/customer/infrastructure/` for an existing staff-facing customer list/search endpoint. If it exists (`GET /customers?search=`), the BFF just proxies it. If not, this story adds it to the backend as a thin read — check the customer controller in the backend too.
> - Read `apps/bff/src/loyalty/loyalty.types.ts` — confirm `LoyaltyBalanceResponse` shape.
> - Confirm `points_per_currency_unit` is accessible from `TenantContext` in the BFF after `M13-S11` ships.

---

#### Part A — Customer search endpoint

Add to `apps/bff/src/customers/customers.controller.ts`:

```typescript
@Get()
@Roles('STAFF', 'MANAGER')
searchCustomers(
  @Query('search') search: string,
  @Query('limit') limit?: string,
): Promise<CustomerSearchListResponse> {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ search });
  if (limit) params.set('limit', limit);
  return this.backendHttp.get<CustomerSearchListResponse>(`/customers?${params}`);
}
```

If the backend `GET /customers` endpoint does not exist, add it in the same commit:
- Backend: `apps/backend/src/contexts/customer/infrastructure/controllers/customer.controller.ts`
- Route: `GET /customers?search=&limit=20`
- Guard: `StaffOrManagerRoleGuard`
- Query: `ILIKE %search%` on `name` + `email`, scoped to `tenantId`, returns `{ customerId, name, email, currentPoints }`
- `currentPoints` requires joining `loyalty_balances` — or calling `ILoyaltyBalanceRepository.findByCustomer()` per result (N+1 acceptable at limit=20 for MVP). Use port, not direct join.

`@ikaro/types` additions (`packages/types/src/customer.dto.ts` or new file):
```typescript
export interface CustomerSearchResult {
  readonly customerId: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly email: string;
  readonly currentPoints: number;
}

export interface CustomerSearchListResponse {
  readonly items: CustomerSearchResult[];
  readonly total: number;
}
```

---

#### Part B — Balance response enrichment

Update `apps/bff/src/loyalty/loyalty.controller.ts` `getBalanceAdmin()` (and `getBalance()` for the customer-facing route — feeds `M13-S06`'s `conversionRate` field too):

After fetching balance from backend, read `points_per_currency_unit` from tenant context and append it:

```typescript
@Get('customers/:customerId/loyalty/balance')
@Roles('MANAGER', 'STAFF')
async getBalanceAdmin(
  @Param('customerId', ParseUUIDPipe) customerId: string,
): Promise<EnrichedLoyaltyBalanceResponse> {
  const balance = await this.backendHttp.get<LoyaltyBalanceResponse>(
    `/customers/${customerId}/loyalty/balance`,
  );
  return {
    ...balance,
    conversionRate: this.tenantContext.settings.loyalty.points_per_currency_unit,
  };
}
```

Similarly enrich `getBalance()` (customer-own route) — `M13-S06`'s loyalty strip and `M13-S29`'s Fidelidade page both need `conversionRate` there too.

`@ikaro/types` — fix and extend (`packages/types/src/loyalty.dto.ts`):
```typescript
// Replace the stale LoyaltyBalanceResponse:
export interface LoyaltyBalanceResponse {
  readonly currentPoints: number;
  readonly nextExpiryDate: string | null;   // ISO-8601
  readonly nextExpiryPoints: number | null;
}

export interface EnrichedLoyaltyBalanceResponse extends LoyaltyBalanceResponse {
  readonly conversionRate: number; // points_per_currency_unit; 0 = redemption disabled
}

// Replace the stale LoyaltyEntryResponse:
export interface LoyaltyEntryItem {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly serviceName: string;
  readonly points: number;
  readonly earnedAt: string;  // ISO-8601
  readonly expiresAt: string; // ISO-8601
  readonly isActive: boolean; // expiresAt > now
}

export interface LoyaltyRedemptionItem {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly pointsRedeemed: number;
  readonly amountDeducted: number;
  readonly redeemedAt: string; // ISO-8601
  readonly bookingId: string | null;
  readonly notes: string | null;
}

export interface PaginatedLoyaltyEntriesResponse {
  readonly items: LoyaltyEntryItem[];
  readonly total: number;
  readonly page: number;
  readonly limit: number;
}

export interface PaginatedLoyaltyRedemptionsResponse {
  readonly items: LoyaltyRedemptionItem[];
  readonly total: number;
  readonly page: number;
  readonly limit: number;
}
```

> **Breaking change:** `LoyaltyBalanceResponse` shape changes. Since no frontend currently consumes it (loyalty frontend doesn't exist yet), this is safe. The BFF's `loyalty.types.ts` local type must also be aligned.

Also extend `UpdateTenantSettingsRequest` (defined in `M13-S10`) with `pointsPerCurrencyUnit?: number` so `M13-S31` (Configurações form) can save it.

---

#### Part C — `discountByPoints` forwarded through completion

Update `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` complete route body schema:

```typescript
const CompleteBookingBodySchema = z.object({
  lines: z.array(z.object({
    lineId: z.uuid(),
    actualPriceCharged: z.number().nonnegative(),
  })).min(1),
  afterServicePhotoUrls: z.array(z.string()).optional().default([]),
  adminNotes: z.string().optional(),
  discountByPoints: z.object({
    pointsUsed: z.number().int().positive(),
    amountDeducted: z.number().positive(),
  }).optional(),
});
```

Forward `discountByPoints` to backend in the request body. No BFF-side validation — backend is authoritative.

`@ikaro/types` addition:
```typescript
export interface CompleteBookingRequest {
  readonly lines: CompleteBookingLineInput[];
  readonly afterServicePhotoUrls?: string[];
  readonly adminNotes?: string;
  readonly discountByPoints?: {
    readonly pointsUsed: number;
    readonly amountDeducted: number;
  };
}
```

---

**HTTP files:**
- `apps/bff/http/customers/customers.http` — add `GET /v1/customers?search=` block with STAFF token
- `apps/bff/http/loyalty/loyalty.http` — update balance block to show `conversionRate` in response
- `apps/bff/http/bookings/bookings.http` — update complete block to show `discountByPoints` example

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/customers?search=jo` with STAFF JWT → list of matching customers with `currentPoints`
- [ ] `GET /v1/customers` with CUSTOMER JWT → `403`
- [ ] `GET /v1/customers/:id/loyalty/balance` response includes `conversionRate` field (0 when disabled)
- [ ] `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/complete` forwards `discountByPoints` to backend when present
- [ ] `LoyaltyBalanceResponse`, `EnrichedLoyaltyBalanceResponse`, `LoyaltyEntryItem`, `LoyaltyRedemptionItem`, `PaginatedLoyaltyEntriesResponse`, `PaginatedLoyaltyRedemptionsResponse`, `CompleteBookingRequest`, `CustomerSearchResult`, `CustomerSearchListResponse` all exported from `packages/types/src/index.ts`
- [ ] `UpdateTenantSettingsRequest` (from `M13-S10`) extended with `pointsPerCurrencyUnit?: number`
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes across monorepo (breaking type change handled everywhere)

**Dependencies:** M13-S11

## Phase 2 — Auth frontend

---

### M13-S13 — Staff login frontend: `/dashboard/login`, `/auth/first-login`, `/auth/error`

*(formerly M124-S02)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-022 UC-025, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/login/dev-notes.md`

**Description:**
Three static server-component pages covering the complete staff authentication surface (UC-022 and UC-025). All BFF redirects for staff already land in the right places; this story just creates the pages those redirects point to.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Check `apps/web/app/dashboard/` — a `page.tsx` stub may exist; read it. Check `apps/web/app/auth/login/page.tsx` — a 3-line stub exists at the wrong route; delete it in this story (nothing links to `/auth/login`). Verify `apps/web/middleware.ts` does NOT exist yet (it is created in `M13-S15`). If it does exist, read it before touching any route.

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/login/00-staff-login.html` → `plan/journey/shared/staff-login.html` (staff login screen)
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/login/01-first-login.html` (invite not accepted)
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/login/01b-error.html`, `01c-error-email-mismatch.html`, `01d-error-tenant-deactivated.html` and `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/login/01b-error.html` (shared error page)

**What to create / delete:**

`apps/web/app/dashboard/login/page.tsx` — server component:

```typescript
// Reads optional ?error= from searchParams; renders the staff login screen.
// No data fetching — static.
```

Renders (per `shared/staff-login.html`):
- Ikaro logomark (SVG or `<img>`)
- Heading: `"Área da Equipe"`
- Subtext: `"Acesso exclusivo para funcionários e gerentes"`
- If `searchParams.error === 'not-a-staff-member'`: inline red alert box above the button — `"Sua conta Google não está cadastrada como funcionário neste estabelecimento."` + retry button
- Google Sign-In button: `<a href="/api/auth/google?state=__staff__">` — full page navigation (not `fetch`)
- Footer note: `"Primeiro acesso? Use o link enviado no e-mail de convite."`

> Note: the Google Sign-In button is a plain `<a>` tag (full redirect), not a form submit or client-side fetch, because OAuth requires a browser navigation to set the state cookie correctly.

`apps/web/app/auth/first-login/page.tsx` — server component:

Renders (per `01-first-login.html`):
- Envelope icon in blue circle (use an SVG icon or emoji placeholder; do not install a new icon library)
- Heading: `"Acesso ainda não ativado"`
- Explanation paragraph: staff must use the invite link from their email
- 3-step instruction list (match prototype text exactly — pt-BR)
- Note: `"Não recebeu o e-mail? Peça ao gerente que reenvie o convite."`
- `"Voltar ao login"` link → `/dashboard/login`

`apps/web/app/auth/error/page.tsx` — server component (shared by staff + customer):

`searchParams.reason` drives content:

| `reason` | Heading | Message | CTA label | CTA href |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `not-a-staff-member` | `"Acesso não autorizado"` | `"Sua conta Google não está cadastrada como funcionário neste estabelecimento."` | `"Voltar ao login"` | `/dashboard/login` |
| `email-mismatch` | `"Acesso não autorizado"` | `"Por favor, use o e-mail para o qual você foi convidado(a)."` | `"Voltar ao login"` | `/dashboard/login` |
| `invite-not-found` | `"Convite não encontrado"` | `"Nenhum convite pendente foi encontrado para este estabelecimento."` | `"Voltar ao login"` | `/dashboard/login` |
| `tenant-not-found` | `"Estabelecimento não encontrado"` | `"O link de convite é inválido ou o estabelecimento foi removido."` | `"Voltar ao site"` | `/` |
| `tenant-deactivated` | `"Estabelecimento desativado"` | `"Este estabelecimento está temporariamente desativado."` | `"Voltar ao site"` | `/` |
| `no-tenant` | `"Não foi possível entrar"` | `"Nenhum estabelecimento encontrado para sua conta Google."` | `"Voltar ao site"` | `/` |
| _(unknown / missing)_ | `"Erro de autenticação"` | `"Ocorreu um erro inesperado. Tente novamente."` | `"Voltar"` | `"javascript:history.back()"` |

Show `reason` code at bottom in small grey text for support reference (e.g. `"Código: not-a-staff-member"`).

**Delete:**

`apps/web/app/auth/login/page.tsx` — the existing 3-line stub at `/auth/login`. This route is not referenced anywhere and conflicts with the convention. Remove the file and the `login/` directory under `auth/`.

**Testing:**

These are `app/**/page.tsx` server components — do not write Vitest unit tests. Acceptance is verified by the AC below; full E2E coverage belongs to a future Playwright suite.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /dashboard/login` renders the staff login screen; Google button href = `/api/auth/google?state=__staff__` (confirm exact BFF route prefix)
- [ ] `GET /dashboard/login?error=not-a-staff-member` renders inline red alert; page does not redirect
- [ ] `GET /auth/first-login` renders the invite-not-accepted screen with "Voltar ao login" link
- [ ] `GET /auth/error?reason=not-a-staff-member` renders correct heading + message + CTA
- [ ] `GET /auth/error?reason=no-tenant` renders correct heading + message + CTA pointing to `/`
- [ ] `GET /auth/error` (no reason) renders fallback error message without throwing
- [ ] `apps/web/app/auth/login/page.tsx` deleted
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S02 not strictly required (staff redirects already correct), but sequenced after it to keep story order clean — can be developed in parallel.

---

### M13-S14 — Customer login frontend: `/{slug}/login`, `/select-tenant`, phone completion

*(formerly M124-S03)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-021 UC-023, `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/login/dev-notes.md`, `docs/15-HOTSITE_DYNAMIC_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Description:**
Three customer-facing auth pages: the tenant-branded login screen, the multi-tenant selection screen (UC-021 Case B), and an inline phone completion prompt (UC-021 A3). All BFF endpoints already exist after `M13-S02` is applied.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Confirm `M13-S02` is merged (cookie fix + customer redirect to `/{slug}`)
> - Read `apps/web/app/[slug]/layout.tsx` — phone prompt goes here
> - Read `apps/web/lib/api/` to understand existing fetcher conventions before adding new ones
> - Verify the BFF route prefix for auth: is it `/api/auth/...` or `/v1/auth/...`? Check `apps/web/` next.config or API route proxying to confirm
> - Confirm `TenantOption` is in `@ikaro/types` (added in `M13-S02`)

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/shared/login.html` (customer login screen)
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/login/01-select-tenant.html` (tenant selection)
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/login/02-phone-completion.html` (phone prompt — rendered inline, not as a page)

**What to create:**

---

#### `apps/web/app/[slug]/login/page.tsx` — server component

Fetches hotsite config to get tenant branding; renders the customer login screen.

```typescript
// Params: { slug: string }
// Fetches: GET /v1/hotsite/{slug}/config → { name, branding: { logoUrl, primaryColor } }
// If tenant not found → notFound()
```

Renders (per `shared/login.html`):
- Tenant logo: if `branding.logoUrl` → `<img src={logoUrl} alt={tenantName}>`, else name-initial avatar with `--ba-primary` background
- Heading: `"Entrar na {tenantName}"`
- Subtext: `"Entre com sua conta Google para agendar"`
- If `searchParams.error` present → inline red alert with a generic `"Erro ao entrar. Tente novamente."` message (BFF error detail not shown to customers)
- Google Sign-In button: `<a href="/api/auth/google?tenantSlug={slug}">` (full page navigation)
- Terms notice (pt-BR)

`generateMetadata`: `title: \`Entrar — {tenantName}\``

---

#### `apps/web/app/select-tenant/page.tsx` — `'use client'`

Shown when the customer belongs to 2+ tenants (UC-021 Case B). BFF has already issued a selection token and redirected here with `?token=<selectionToken>`.

```typescript
// Reads ?token= from searchParams (passed as prop from server wrapper)
// On mount: decodes or fetches the tenant list
// On tenant click: POST /api/auth/token { selectionToken, tenantId }
//   → { tenantSlug } → router.push(`/${tenantSlug}`)
```

> 🔍 **Discover:** Does the `selectionToken` contain the tenant list encoded (JWT-like, decodable without a server call), or does the frontend need to call `GET /api/auth/tenants?token=...` first? Check `apps/bff/src/auth/selection-token.service.ts` — if `issueSelectionToken` only encodes `{ googleOAuthId }` (not the tenant list), the frontend must call a separate endpoint to get the list. If no such endpoint exists, add it to this story's scope or decode via `POST /auth/token` with a dry-run approach. **Resolve this before writing any component code.**

Renders (per `01-select-tenant.html`):
- Heading: `"Selecionar Estabelecimento"`
- Subtext: `"Você tem acesso a mais de um estabelecimento."`
- List of `TenantOption` cards, each showing:
  - Name-initial avatar (use `--ba-primary` placeholder until per-tenant color is available)
  - Tenant name (bold)
  - `"{loyaltyPoints} pontos ativos"` (or `"0 pontos"`)
  - Chevron right
  - Tappable → calls `POST /auth/token`
- Loading state: 2–3 skeleton cards while data loads
- Error state: token invalid/expired → `"Sessão expirada. Tente entrar novamente."` with link back to `/auth/login` (the generic entry)

On `POST /api/auth/token` success: `{ tenantSlug }` → `router.push(`/${tenantSlug}`)`.

`@ikaro/types` addition (if not already in `M13-S02`): `TenantOption` must include `primaryColor?: string` if the BFF selection token carries it — verify and add the field if present.

---

#### `apps/web/components/customer/PhoneCompletionPrompt.tsx` — `'use client'`

An inline bottom-sheet prompt shown to customers who have no `phone` set (UC-021 A3). Mounts inside `apps/web/app/[slug]/layout.tsx`.

```typescript
// On mount: GET /api/customers/me → { phone: string | null }
// If phone != null OR user is not authenticated (no cookie / 401) → render nothing
// If phone == null → show bottom sheet
```

Sheet content (per `02-phone-completion.html`):
- Heading: `"Completar seu perfil"`
- Subtext: `"Informe seu telefone para receber confirmações de agendamento."`
- Phone input: `<input type="tel" placeholder="(11) 99999-9999">`
  - Client-side mask: strip non-digits; display as `(XX) XXXXX-XXXX` or `(XX) XXXX-XXXX`
  - Validation: stripped digits must be 10 or 11 characters
- `"Salvar"` button — disabled until valid
- `"Agora não"` dismiss link (dismisses for the session, does not persist)

On submit:
```
PATCH /api/customers/me { phone: "<stripped-digits>" }
→ 200: close sheet
→ 422 { type: 'invalid-phone' }: "Digite um número de telefone válido (10 ou 11 dígitos)."
→ other error: "Erro ao salvar. Tente novamente."
```

Add `PhoneCompletionPrompt` to `apps/web/app/[slug]/layout.tsx`:
```tsx
// Server layout renders children; PhoneCompletionPrompt is a client component
// that mounts and self-checks; it renders nothing until it confirms phone == null.
<PhoneCompletionPrompt />
{children}
```

**Testing:**

All three pages are `app/**/page.tsx` — do not unit-test. `PhoneCompletionPrompt` is a complex stateful client component — Playwright E2E. No Vitest coverage required for this story; SonarCloud `sonar.coverage.exclusions` already covers `apps/web/app/**/page.tsx`.

**`apps/web/lib/api/` additions:**

```typescript
// apps/web/lib/api/auth.ts
fetchTenantOptions(token: string): Promise<TenantOption[]>
issueToken(selectionToken: string, tenantId: string): Promise<IssueTokenResponse>
// (cookie set server-side by BFF; response body gives tenantSlug for redirect)

// apps/web/lib/api/customers.ts (or extend existing)
getCustomerProfile(): Promise<CustomerProfileResponse>
updateCustomerProfile(body: { phone: string }): Promise<CustomerProfileResponse>
```

Follow the naming and error-handling pattern of existing fetchers in `apps/web/lib/api/`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

*Customer login page:*
- [ ] `GET /{slug}/login` renders tenant name + logo (or initial fallback)
- [ ] `generateMetadata` returns `title: "Entrar — {tenantName}"`
- [ ] Google button href routes to BFF OAuth with correct `tenantSlug` param
- [ ] `GET /{slug}/login?error=anything` shows inline red alert
- [ ] Unknown slug → `notFound()` (404 page)

*Select-tenant page:*
- [ ] `GET /select-tenant?token=<valid>` renders list of tenant cards with name + loyalty points
- [ ] Clicking a card calls `POST /api/auth/token`; on success redirects to `/{tenantSlug}`
- [ ] Expired / invalid token → error banner with link back to login
- [ ] Loading skeleton visible before data resolves

*Phone completion prompt:*
- [ ] Prompt does NOT appear when `GET /api/customers/me` returns `phone != null`
- [ ] Prompt does NOT appear when request is unauthenticated (guest, no cookie)
- [ ] Prompt appears as bottom sheet when `phone == null`
- [ ] Submit disabled while phone input < 10 digits
- [ ] Valid submit → `PATCH /api/customers/me` → sheet closes
- [ ] `422` → inline error message in pt-BR; sheet stays open
- [ ] "Agora não" dismisses for session; prompt does not reappear on route change within the session

*General:*
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes across monorepo
- [ ] `pnpm lint` zero warnings
- [ ] No new `any` types introduced

**Dependencies:** M13-S02 (cookie fix must be deployed; customer redirect must land on `/{slug}`)

---

## Phase 3 — Dashboard shells

---

### M13-S15 — Dashboard shell: layout, middleware, auth guard (staff + manager)

*(formerly M125-S01)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`
**Journey prototype:** `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/` — reviewed; UC-003/004/005 audit done 2026-06-16; UC-008/009 audit done same day

**Description:**
Implement the foundational shell that every staff/manager dashboard page will live inside. This is the prerequisite for all Phase 4–8 stories — nothing else can be built until the layout exists.

The shell matches `plan/journey/shared/dashboard-shell.html` and `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/00-agenda.html`:
- **Mobile (`<1024px`):** sticky topbar (brand + avatar) + `main` + bottom tab nav (Agenda | Horários | Serviços | Fidelidade | + Manager-only tabs)
- **Desktop (`≥1024px`):** fixed left sidebar (logo, nav, manager section, user footer) + topbar (page title + date + avatar) + `main`
- **Role-aware nav:** "Somente Gerente" section in sidebar is only rendered when JWT role = MANAGER

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Check `apps/web/app/dashboard/` — there may be a `layout.tsx` stub or middleware already. If `apps/web/middleware.ts` exists, read it in full before adding route protection. Read `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` for canonical folder structure before placing any new files.

**What to create:**

`apps/web/middleware.ts` — route protection for `/dashboard/**`:
- Read JWT from `httpOnly` cookie (same cookie set by UC-022/UC-025 login flow)
- If no JWT or JWT role is not `STAFF` | `MANAGER` → redirect to `/dashboard/login`
- If JWT valid → pass through

`apps/web/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — server component:
- Reads JWT from cookie (server-side, via `cookies()`)
- Extracts `{ tenantSlug, tenantName, userName, role }` from JWT payload
- Renders `<DashboardShell>` with those props

`apps/web/components/dashboard/DashboardShell.tsx` — `'use client'`, the shell wrapper:
- Sidebar (desktop) + topbar + `<main>` + bottom nav (mobile)
- Accepts `role: 'STAFF' | 'MANAGER'` and conditionally renders manager-only nav items

`apps/web/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx`:
- Logo block (tenant name + slug)
- Nav items: Agenda, Horários, Serviços, **Fidelidade** (STAFF + MANAGER — links to `/dashboard/loyalty`, see `M13-S25`)
- "Somente Gerente" label + Equipe + Configurações + **Hotsite** (MANAGER only — hidden for STAFF)

> **Fix folded in during consolidation:** the original draft of this story only listed "Equipe + Configurações" under "Somente Gerente", omitting Hotsite — even though `dashboard-shell.html` and every manager prototype include it as a third item (caught during the `M13-S35`–`M13-S37` cross-file audit). Include all three from the start: Equipe, Configurações, Hotsite.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/Topbar.tsx`:
- Back arrow + title (drill-down pages)
- Page title (list pages)
- Status badge slot (optional — used by detail page)
- Avatar + today's date (desktop)

`apps/web/components/dashboard/BottomNav.tsx`:
- Mobile only (`<1024px`)
- Tabs matching sidebar nav items (role-aware)

**`dashboard-shell.html` CSS class reference (do not invent new classes — use what's in `shared/tokens.css`):**

| tokens.css class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.dashboard-topbar` | Sticky topbar wrapper |
| `.topbar-page-title` | Page title (hidden mobile) |
| `.topbar-date` | Date string (hidden mobile) |
| `.dashboard-layout` | Sidebar + main grid |
| `.sidebar` | Left sidebar (hidden mobile) |
| `.sidebar-header` | Logo + tenant name block |
| `.sidebar-nav` / `.sidebar-nav-item` / `.sidebar-nav-icon` | Nav items |
| `.sidebar-section-label` | "Somente Gerente" label |
| `.sidebar-footer` | Avatar + name + logout |
| `.main-content` | Right main area |
| `.dashboard-body` | Content padding wrapper |
| `.bottom-nav` | Mobile tab bar (hidden desktop) |
| `.auth-avatar` | Clickable avatar (NOT `.topbar-avatar` — hidden desktop) |
| `.role-badge` / `.role-badge-manager` | Role chip |
| `.status-badge` / `.status-pending` / `.status-approved` / etc. | Status chips |

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /dashboard` redirects to `/dashboard/bookings` (or first meaningful page) — no blank screen
- [ ] Unauthenticated request to `/dashboard/**` redirects to staff login
- [ ] JWT with role `CUSTOMER` redirects to staff login (not a valid dashboard user)
- [ ] Sidebar visible at `≥1024px`; bottom nav visible at `<1024px`; neither both at once
- [ ] Manager-only nav section visible when role = MANAGER; hidden when role = STAFF; section includes Equipe, Configurações, AND Hotsite
- [ ] `auth-avatar` (not `topbar-avatar`) used for all avatar elements — avatar is visible on both mobile and desktop
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M03 (JWT structure), M13-S13 (staff login sets cookie)

---

### M13-S16 — Customer shell: layout, auth guard, route protection

*(formerly M126-S01)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`
**Parallel with:** M13-S06–M13-S08 (already landed in Phase 1, so no actual blocking here)

**Description:**
Implement the foundational shell for the customer area. All `/{slug}/minha-conta/**` routes require a valid CUSTOMER JWT — unauthenticated users must be redirected to login. The visual shell matches `plan/journey/shared/customer-dashboard.html` and `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/01-minha-conta.html`.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Check `apps/web/app/[slug]/` for any existing `minha-conta/` folder or `layout.tsx`. Check `apps/web/middleware.ts` — read it in full before extending it; the staff guard (added in `M13-S15`) must not be broken. Read `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the canonical folder structure before placing any files.

**What to create:**

Extend `apps/web/middleware.ts` — add protection for `/{slug}/minha-conta/**`:
- Read JWT from `access_token` httpOnly cookie
- If missing or expired → redirect to `/{slug}/login`
- If JWT role is not `CUSTOMER` → redirect to `/{slug}/login` (staff must not reach customer area)
- If valid → pass through; the `tenantSlug` in the JWT must match the `[slug]` path segment

`apps/web/app/[slug]/minha-conta/layout.tsx` — server component:
- Reads JWT from cookie (server-side via `cookies()`)
- Extracts `{ tenantName, userName, role }` from payload
- Renders `<CustomerShell tenantName={...} userName={...} />`

`apps/web/components/customer/CustomerShell.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- `dashboard-topbar` (brand: tenant logo/name + "+ Novo agendamento" desktop shortcut + avatar dropdown with "Sair" and "Site Ikaro" links)
- Customer tab nav — **desktop only (`≥1024px`)**: Início | Agendamentos | Fidelidade (horizontal tab bar below topbar, same `.customer-nav` pattern from prototype)
- `<main class="main-content">` content slot
- `bottom-nav` — **mobile only (`<1024px`)**: 3 tabs — Início | Agendamentos | Fidelidade

**CSS class reference (do not invent new classes — use `shared/tokens.css`):**

| tokens.css class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.dashboard-topbar` | Sticky topbar wrapper |
| `.topbar-brand` / `.topbar-logo-mark` / `.topbar-tenant-name` | Brand block |
| `.dashboard-layout` / `.main-content` / `.dashboard-body` | Content layout |
| `.bottom-nav` / `.bottom-nav-item` / `.bottom-nav-icon` | Mobile tab bar |
| `.auth-avatar` | Avatar button |
| `.btn-primary` / `.btn-secondary` / `.btn-danger` | Action buttons |
| `.status-badge` + `.status-*` | Status chips |

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Unauthenticated `GET /{slug}/minha-conta` redirects to `/{slug}/login`
- [ ] JWT with role `STAFF` or `MANAGER` redirects to `/{slug}/login`
- [ ] JWT `tenantSlug` mismatch with URL `[slug]` → redirect to `/{slug}/login`
- [ ] Valid CUSTOMER JWT → shell renders; `userName` shown in avatar dropdown
- [ ] Bottom nav visible at `<1024px`; desktop tab nav visible at `≥1024px`; never both at once
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S02 (cookie set on login), M13-S14 (`/{slug}/login` route exists)

---

## Phase 4 — Staff booking core

> **Discovery note (applies to this entire phase):** Several details will only be resolved when implementation begins — particularly what BFF endpoints already exist vs. what needs adding, and which `@ikaro/types` booking types survived M12. Explicit "🔍 Discover before starting" callouts mark every assumption that must be verified before writing code. Do not skip these — acting on a wrong assumption here caused two CI failures in M12. For `M13-S19`/`M13-S20` specifically: the UC-008/UC-009 audit already confirmed `cancel-admin`, `reschedule`, and `complete` backend+BFF endpoints are fully implemented (not just planned) — these two stories are frontend-only.

---

### M13-S17 — Booking queue page (`/dashboard/bookings`)

*(formerly M125-S03)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/00-agenda.html` (reference), `plan/journey/staff/agenda.md`

**Description:**
Implement the booking queue — grouped by **urgency, not date** (resolved 2026-06-16, see `plan/journey/staff/agenda.md` "Queue scope"): "Precisa de ação" (all PENDING + INFO_REQUESTED, any date), "Hoje" (today's APPROVED, actionable), "Próximos dias" (future APPROVED, read-only glance). This is the first page a staff member sees after logging in.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Verify the exact path of `fetchStaffBookings` — it must call `GET /v1/bookings` with `X-Actor-*` headers forwarded, three times with different query params (see `M13-S03`). Check whether a `lib/api/dashboard/` directory exists or if fetchers live flat in `lib/api/`. Follow whatever convention is already there.

**Prototype reference:** `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/00-agenda.html`
**Route:** `/dashboard/bookings`

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/bookings.ts`:
```typescript
fetchStaffBookings(params: { status: string; date?: string; from?: string; page?: number }): Promise<StaffBookingListResponse>
// GET /v1/bookings, sends auth cookie, X-Actor-* headers
```

`apps/web/app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchStaffBookings` three times in parallel: `{ status: 'PENDING,INFO_REQUESTED' }` (no date), `{ status: 'APPROVED', date: today() }`, `{ status: 'APPROVED', from: tomorrow() }`
- Renders `<BookingQueuePage actionNeeded={...} today={...} upcoming={...} />`
- Empty state handled inline, per section

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/BookingQueuePage.tsx`:
- Three sections, each a `<BookingSection title="..." items={...} />`: "Precisa de ação", "Hoje", "Próximos dias"
- Each card in "Precisa de ação" and "Próximos dias" shows its own date inline (e.g. "Hoje · 10:00", "Amanhã · 09:00", "Qui, 18 de junho · 09:00") since these sections span multiple days — "Hoje" cards show time only (date is implied by the section)
- Empty state per section: "Nenhum agendamento precisa de ação." / "Nenhum agendamento confirmado para hoje." / "Nenhum agendamento confirmado nos próximos dias." (pt-BR, not an error)
- Week-strip (`plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/00-agenda.html`'s `.week-strip`) is a visual "this week at a glance" overview, NOT a filter — clicking "Hoje" scrolls to the Hoje section; clicking any future day scrolls to "Próximos dias" (an approximation — see `agenda.md` open question "Week-strip click target for future days"; a future PENDING booking for that day actually lives in "Precisa de ação", not "Próximos dias")

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/BookingCard.tsx`:
- Customer name (truncated with ellipsis if long)
- Service names joined ", "
- Scheduled time, with date prefix when the card is in "Precisa de ação" or "Próximos dias" (see above)
- Total price + duration
- Status badge (`.status-pending` / `.status-info` / `.status-approved`)
- INFO_REQUESTED card has blue left border (matches prototype `border-left: 3px solid var(--ba-primary)`)
- "Hoje" section cards show "Marcar concluído" as the primary quick action (links into `M13-S20`'s flow) instead of "Aprovar"
- "Próximos dias" section cards have **no quick actions at all** — read-only, nothing to do until the day arrives (matches prototype's `opacity: 0.7`, non-link card)
- Entire card is a link → `/dashboard/bookings/:bookingId` (except "Próximos dias" cards, which are not links)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Page renders three sections from three `fetchStaffBookings` calls, in the order: Precisa de ação, Hoje, Próximos dias
- [ ] "Precisa de ação" includes bookings from any date, sorted by `scheduledAt ASC`, each showing its date inline
- [ ] PENDING cards rendered with correct badge + no left border accent
- [ ] INFO_REQUESTED cards rendered with blue left border accent (see prototype)
- [ ] "Hoje" section only shows today's APPROVED bookings; primary action is "Marcar concluído"
- [ ] "Próximos dias" cards render with no quick actions and are not clickable links
- [ ] Empty state renders pt-BR message per section (not a JS error)
- [ ] Each actionable card links to `/dashboard/bookings/:bookingId`
- [ ] Customer name with long text is truncated (ellipsis) — does not break card layout
- [ ] Page is protected by `M13-S15` middleware — unauthenticated access redirects
- [ ] No decorative filter tabs (Pendentes/Confirmados/Todos) — removed in the 2026-06-16 redesign; the sections themselves are the filter

**Dependencies:** M13-S15, M13-S03

### M13-S18 — Booking detail page + all action flows (`/dashboard/bookings/[id]`)

*(formerly M125-S05)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** L
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-003, UC-004, UC-005, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/01-booking-detail.html`, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/01b-slot-conflict.html`

**Description:**
The core of this milestone: the booking detail page where staff take action on each request. Three actions (approve / reject / request info) each have their own flow, and approval has an error branch (slot conflict). All success and error states are inline — no navigation to a separate page.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Confirm the BFF action endpoints are wired correctly: `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/approve`, `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/reject`, `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/request-info`. These were built in M08/M09 and should exist. Verify their exact request bodies and error codes (409 for slot conflict, 422 for validation). Also check whether `@ikaro/types` has `ApproveBookingRequest`, `RejectBookingRequest`, `RequestMoreInfoRequest` — M12-S07 explicitly dropped these ("re-added when the dashboard story is built"). They need to be re-added here.

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/01-booking-detail.html` — main detail + action panel + bottom sheets
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/01b-slot-conflict.html` — slot conflict (UC-003 A1)
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/01c-reject-success.html` — rejection confirmed inline state
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/01d-info-success.html` — info request sent inline state

**Route:** `/dashboard/bookings/[id]`

**`@ikaro/types` additions (do first, blocks component work):**
```typescript
// packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts
export interface ApproveBookingRequest { }  // empty body

export interface RejectBookingRequest {
  reason: string;  // max 200 chars, required
}

export interface RequestMoreInfoRequest {
  message: string; // max 200 chars, required
}

export interface ApproveBookingResponse {
  bookingId: string;
  status: 'APPROVED';
  approvedAt: string;
}

export interface SlotConflictSuggestion {
  startsAt: string;  // ISO-8601
  endsAt: string;
}

export interface SlotConflictError {
  error: 'slot-conflict';
  suggestions: SlotConflictSuggestion[];
}
```

**API fetcher additions (`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/bookings.ts`):**
```typescript
fetchStaffBookingDetail(bookingId: string): Promise<StaffBookingDetailResponse>
approveBooking(bookingId: string): Promise<ApproveBookingResponse>
// 409 → parse body as SlotConflictError
rejectBooking(bookingId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>
requestMoreInfo(bookingId: string, message: string): Promise<void>
```

**What to create:**

`apps/web/app/dashboard/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchStaffBookingDetail(id)` (with ISR off — booking state must always be fresh)
- If not found → `notFound()`
- Renders `<BookingDetailPage booking={data} />`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/BookingDetailPage.tsx` — `'use client'` (manages action state):
- Renders topbar status badge (changes after action)
- Renders `<BookingDetailMain>` (customer info, lines, photos — read-only)
- Renders `<BookingActionPanel>` on desktop right column; triggers mobile bottom sheet
- Manages `actionState: 'idle' | 'submitting' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'info-requested' | 'slot-conflict'`
- On `approved`: replaces action panel with inline green success banner
- On `rejected`: replaces with inline red banner + reason shown
- On `info-requested`: replaces with inline blue banner + message shown; detail page remains with updated badge
- On `slot-conflict`: renders `<SlotConflictAlert>` with suggested slots

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/BookingDetailMain.tsx` — read-only detail body:
- Customer section: avatar + name + email + phone + loyalty points badge (null → hidden)
- Info request section (if `infoRequestMessage != null`): shows what admin asked + customer's response
- Date/time section
- Service lines table: name | price | duration | points per line; totals row
- Photos grid: before-service photos (if any), `loading="lazy"`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/BookingActionPanel.tsx` — action buttons:
- "Aprovar" (primary) → calls `approveBooking()`; disabled while submitting
- "Rejeitar" (secondary) → opens `<RejectBookingSheet>`
- "Pedir info" (ghost) → opens `<RequestInfoSheet>`
- Hidden once booking is in a terminal/actioned state (`actionState != 'idle'`)

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/RejectBookingSheet.tsx` — bottom sheet (mobile) / panel (desktop):
- Textarea: reason, max 200 chars, required
- Character counter: `X / 200`
- Submit disabled until at least 1 char entered (no enforced minimum in UI — backend validates)
- On submit: calls `rejectBooking()`; on success: parent transitions to `'rejected'`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/RequestInfoSheet.tsx`:
- Textarea: message, max 200 chars, required
- Submit disabled when empty
- On submit: calls `requestMoreInfo()`; on success: parent transitions to `'info-requested'`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/SlotConflictAlert.tsx` — UC-003 A1:
- Red error card: "O horário das HH:MM foi ocupado enquanto você revisava o agendamento."
- List of `SlotConflictSuggestion` as tappable rows: "HH:MM — HH:MM" + "Aprovar neste →"
- Clicking a slot calls `approveBooking()` with the new `scheduledAt`

**Mobile vs. desktop layout (from prototype):**
- Mobile: no sticky action panel; instead fixed `.mobile-action-bar` at bottom (`position: fixed; bottom: 0; env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0)`)
- Desktop (`≥1024px`): two-column grid (`1fr 22rem`); action panel in right column, `position: sticky; top: 1.5rem`
- Bottom nav hidden on this page (`.bottom-nav { display: none !important }` — drill-down page rule)

**Acceptance criteria:**

*Approve (UC-003):*
- [ ] "Aprovar" calls `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/approve`; `200` → inline green banner "Agendamento aprovado!"; topbar badge → APROVADO; action buttons hidden
- [ ] `409` conflict → `<SlotConflictAlert>` with suggestions; selecting a slot calls approve with the new `scheduledAt`
- [ ] Other server error → toast "Erro ao aprovar. Tente novamente."

*Reject (UC-004):*
- [ ] "Rejeitar" opens bottom sheet; submit disabled when textarea empty
- [ ] On confirm: calls `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/reject { reason }`; `200` → inline red banner with reason text; badge → REJEITADO; action buttons hidden
- [ ] Server error → sheet stays open with error message

*Request info (UC-005):*
- [ ] "Pedir info" opens bottom sheet; submit disabled when textarea empty
- [ ] On submit: calls `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/request-info { message }`; `200` → inline blue banner with message text; badge → INFO_SOLICITADO; "Pedir info" button hidden; "Aprovar" and "Rejeitar" remain available (UC-005 A3)
- [ ] Server error → sheet stays open with error message

*Layout:*
- [ ] Mobile (`<1024px`): fixed action bar at bottom; main content scrollable
- [ ] Desktop (`≥1024px`): two-column; action panel sticky on right
- [ ] Bottom nav hidden on this page

*Types:*
- [ ] `ApproveBookingRequest`, `RejectBookingRequest`, `RequestMoreInfoRequest`, `ApproveBookingResponse`, `SlotConflictError`, `SlotConflictSuggestion` added to `packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes across monorepo

**Dependencies:** M13-S15, M13-S04

### M13-S19 — Booking lifecycle: cancel + reschedule (UC-008)

*(formerly M125-S11)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-008, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/03-booking-detail-approved.html`, `05-reschedule.html`, `05b-reschedule-conflict.html`, `dev-notes.md`

**Description:**
Extends `BookingDetailPage` (`M13-S18`) with a second action panel — `BookingLifecyclePanel` — rendered when `booking.status === 'APPROVED'` instead of `BookingActionPanel`. Staff can cancel an approved booking (optional reason, no enforced minimum) or reschedule it to a new slot. Booking stays `APPROVED` after a reschedule — it is not a status transition. Backend + BFF endpoints already exist and were verified in the 2026-06-16 UC audit (`cancel-admin`, `reschedule` — both fully implemented, not just planned).

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Confirm `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/cancel` (BFF dispatches to backend `/cancel-admin` for STAFF|MANAGER) and `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/reschedule` are wired exactly as found in the audit (`apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` lines ~306–337 at time of audit — re-verify line numbers). Confirm whether the booking flow's `AvailabilityCalendar` component (built for the guest/customer booking flow, UC-011) is extracted in a way `RescheduleBookingCalendar` can reuse without pulling in basket/duration-recompute logic — reschedule duration is frozen at the existing booking's `totalDurationMins`. Decide: nested routes (`/dashboard/bookings/[id]/reschedule`) vs. a modal/sheet over `[id]` — the prototype models both cancel (sheet) and reschedule (full screen) but doesn't mandate the production routing approach.

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/03-booking-detail-approved.html` — APPROVED branch of the detail page + inline cancel sheet
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/03b-cancel-success.html` — cancel success inline state
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/05-reschedule.html` — calendar + "Revisar reagendamento" summary
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/05b-reschedule-conflict.html` — 409 conflict + adjacent slot suggestions
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/05c-reschedule-success.html` — reschedule success inline state (booking stays APPROVED, panel returns)

**Route:** `/dashboard/bookings/[id]` (same route as `M13-S18`, branched by status) + reschedule sub-route (TBD — see discovery)

**`@ikaro/types` additions (`packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`):**
```typescript
export interface CancelBookingAsAdminRequest { bookingId: string; reason?: string; }
export interface CancelBookingAsAdminResponse { id: string; status: 'CANCELLED'; cancelledAt: string; }
export interface RescheduleBookingRequest { bookingId: string; scheduledAt: string; adminNotes?: string; }
export interface RescheduleBookingResponse { id: string; status: 'APPROVED'; scheduledAt: string; }
```

**API fetcher additions (`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/bookings.ts`):**
```typescript
cancelBookingAsAdmin(bookingId: string, reason?: string): Promise<CancelBookingAsAdminResponse>
rescheduleBooking(bookingId: string, scheduledAt: string, adminNotes?: string): Promise<RescheduleBookingResponse>
// 409 → parse body as SlotConflictError (same shape as approve's 409, reused)
```

**What to create:**

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/BookingLifecyclePanel.tsx` — Marcar concluído (primary, links into `M13-S20`) / Reagendar (secondary) / Cancelar (secondary) buttons. Renders in `BookingDetailPage`'s desktop aside / mobile action bar, replacing `BookingActionPanel` when `status === 'APPROVED'`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/AdminCancelBookingSheet.tsx` — bottom sheet: reason textarea, **optional**, no minimum length (unlike Reject's required ≥10 chars — confirmed in the UC audit against `CancelBookingAsAdminBody`). On confirm: calls `cancelBookingAsAdmin()`; success → parent `actionState = 'cancelled'`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/RescheduleBookingCalendar.tsx` — reuses `AvailabilityCalendar` (day-pill/slot-btn UI from UC-011). "Revisar reagendamento" summary panel (De/Para slot comparison, live-updates as a new slot is picked) per the README's "Summary card" convention. On confirm: calls `rescheduleBooking()`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/RescheduleConflictAlert.tsx` — same pattern as `SlotConflictAlert` (`M13-S18`), reused for the reschedule confirm's 409 response.

**`actionState` additions to `BookingDetailPage`** (extends `M13-S18`'s machine):
```typescript
type ActionState = /* ...existing... */
  | 'cancelled'           // UC-008 success — red banner, terminal
  | 'rescheduled'         // UC-008 A1 success — green banner, NOT terminal — panel buttons return (status stays APPROVED)
  | 'reschedule-conflict' // UC-008 A1 → 409
```

**Acceptance criteria:**

*Cancel:*
- [ ] "Cancelar agendamento"/"Cancelar" opens `AdminCancelBookingSheet`; submit is never disabled (reason is optional)
- [ ] Confirm → `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/cancel`; `200` → inline red banner "Agendamento cancelado"; badge → CANCELADO; no further actions (terminal)

*Reschedule:*
- [ ] "Reagendar" opens calendar; summary panel shows current slot → newly selected slot, updating live as a slot is picked
- [ ] Confirm → `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/reschedule`; `200` → inline green banner with old/new slot; badge stays APROVADO; `BookingLifecyclePanel` buttons return (not terminal)
- [ ] `409` → `RescheduleConflictAlert` with adjacent slot suggestions; picking one retries the reschedule

*Layout:*
- [ ] Same `detail-layout` two-column / `mobile-action-bar` shell as `M13-S18` — no bespoke layout
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15, M13-S18, M12 (`AvailabilityCalendar` component — verify it exists and is reusable)

---

### M13-S20 — Mark booking complete (UC-009)

*(formerly M125-S12)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-009, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/04-mark-complete.html`, `04b-complete-success.html`

**Description:**
The "Marcar concluído" action from `BookingLifecyclePanel` (`M13-S19`) — staff confirm a completed wash, optionally adjusting the actual price charged per line (discount/waiver — defaults to the quoted `priceAtBooking`), uploading after-service photos, and adding notes. Triggers loyalty point earning server-side (computed from `pointsValueAtBooking`, unaffected by `actualPriceCharged`). Backend + BFF endpoint already exist (verified in the 2026-06-16 UC audit — `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/complete` is fully implemented).

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Same routing question as `M13-S19` (nested route vs. modal/sheet over `[id]`) — decide once, apply to both stories consistently. Confirm the after-service photo upload reuses the same GCS signed-URL upload component/pattern as the guest/customer "before" photos (M115-S01), not a new implementation.

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/04-mark-complete.html` — per-line price editor + photo upload + notes
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/04b-complete-success.html` — completion success inline state (cotado vs. cobrado summary)

**Route:** `/dashboard/bookings/[id]/complete` (TBD — see `M13-S19` discovery)

**`@ikaro/types` additions (`packages/types/src/booking.dto.ts`):**
```typescript
export interface CompleteBookingLineInput { lineId: string; actualPriceCharged: number; }
export interface CompleteBookingRequest {
  bookingId: string;
  lines: CompleteBookingLineInput[];   // required, one entry per line, even if unchanged
  afterServicePhotoUrls?: string[];
  adminNotes?: string;
}
export interface CompleteBookingResponse {
  id: string; status: 'COMPLETED'; completedAt: string; totalActualPrice: number;
}
```

> Note: `M13-S12` extends `CompleteBookingRequest` with an optional `discountByPoints` field for the loyalty redemption strip — see `M13-S26`.

**API fetcher additions (`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/bookings.ts`):**
```typescript
completeBooking(body: CompleteBookingRequest): Promise<CompleteBookingResponse>
// PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/complete
```

**What to create:**

`apps/web/components/dashboard/bookings/MarkCompleteSheet.tsx`:
- One row per booking line: service name, quoted price (read-only), editable "charged" amount pre-filled with `priceAtBooking`
- Live-updating total (`Total a cobrar`), recalculated on every keystroke, client-side only — no BFF round-trip
- After-service photo upload — optional, reuses M115-S01's signed-URL upload component
- Notes textarea — optional
- "Confirmar conclusão" lives in the same sticky aside (desktop) / fixed bottom bar (mobile) as every other actionable screen — not inline at the end of the form

**`actionState` addition to `BookingDetailPage`:**
```typescript
| 'completed'  // UC-009 success — green banner with cotado-vs-cobrado summary, terminal
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Each line's "charged" input defaults to `priceAtBooking`; editing it updates the live total immediately
- [ ] Confirming with all lines unchanged sends `actualPriceCharged === priceAtBooking` for every line (not omitted)
- [ ] Photos are optional — confirming with zero photos succeeds (UC-009 A3)
- [ ] `200` → inline green banner: per-line quoted-vs-charged + total quoted-vs-charged + "ganhou N pontos de fidelidade"; badge → CONCLUÍDO; no further actions (terminal)
- [ ] Primary action button lives in sticky aside (desktop) / fixed bottom bar (mobile), matching `M13-S18`/`M13-S19`'s shell
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15, M13-S18, M13-S19 (entry point), M115-S01 (photo upload pattern)

## Phase 5 — Staff schedule & services

---

### M13-S21 — Horários: schedule management page + closure/opening flows

*(formerly M125-S06)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** L
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-010, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/horarios/dev-notes.md`, `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Description:**
Implement the Horários section of the staff dashboard — a weekly schedule view where staff can see approved bookings on a time grid and manage schedule closures (UC-010a, UC-010b) and special openings (UC-010c, UC-010d). All backend and BFF endpoints for this section are already implemented; this is a **frontend-only story**.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Verify that `GET /v1/schedule/closures`, `POST /v1/schedule/closures`, `DELETE /v1/schedule/closures/:id`, `GET /v1/schedule/openings`, `POST /v1/schedule/openings`, and `DELETE /v1/schedule/openings/:id` exist in `apps/bff/src/` and return the shapes described below. Check `GET /v1/bookings?status=APPROVED&from=...&to=...` — this likely exists from `M13-S03`; confirm the `from`/`to` filter params work for a date range. Verify `apps/bff/http/schedule/` exists; if `schedule-openings.http` or `availability.http` are missing, create them as part of this story.

**Prototype reference:** `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/horarios/` (10 screens — `00-schedule.html` through `06-remove-opening.html`)
**Route:** `/dashboard/schedule`

**What to create:**

`apps/web/app/dashboard/schedule/page.tsx` — server component:
- Fetches closures, openings, and approved bookings for current week (Mon–Sun)
- Reads `businessHours` from tenant settings
- Renders `<ScheduleView initialClosures={...} initialOpenings={...} initialBookings={...} businessHours={...} tenantSlug={...} />`

`apps/web/components/schedule/ScheduleView.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Holds `ScheduleState` (see below)
- Renders `<WeekNav>` (imported from `components/dashboard/WeekNav.tsx` — created in `M13-S17`) above the week strip
- Week strip: Mon–Sun day buttons; selected day shown in time grid below
- Time grid: slots from `businessHours[dayOfWeek].open` to `.close`; closed days → empty state + "Abrir dia especial" CTA
- Booking blocks: blue left border + `--ba-secondary` bg; link to `/dashboard/bookings/[id]`
- Closure blocks: grey hatch (`repeating-linear-gradient 135deg`); click opens `RemoveClosureDialog`
- Booking inside a closure window: orange tint + warning icon (UC-010a A4)
- Open days: FAB `+ Bloquear período` → opens `ClosureFormSheet`
- Closed (business-hours) days: FAB replaced with "Abrir dia especial" CTA → opens `OpeningFormSheet`
- Week strip dots: green dot per day with ≥1 approved booking or a ScheduleOpening; closed days at 40% opacity
- Advancing a week: set `startOfWeek + 7 days`, re-fetch all three lists via client-side BFF calls

```ts
type ScheduleState = {
  startOfWeek: Date;
  selectedDate: Date;
  closureSheet: 'closed' | 'open' | 'submitting' | 'conflict' | 'warning';
  openingSheet: 'closed' | 'open' | 'submitting' | 'conflict';
  removeClosureTarget: ScheduleClosure | null;
  removeOpeningTarget: ScheduleOpening | null;
}
```

`apps/web/components/schedule/ClosureFormSheet.tsx` — shadcn `<Sheet side="bottom">` (desktop: `side="right"`):

| Field | Component | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `date` | `<Input type="date">` | required; not in the past |
| `reason` | `<Select>` | required; `STAFF_DAY_OFF` / `MAINTENANCE` / `HOLIDAY` |
| `startTime` | `<Input type="time">` | optional; if set, `endTime` required |
| `endTime` | `<Input type="time">` | optional; must be > `startTime` |
| `notes` | `<Textarea>` | optional; max 200 chars |

pt-BR labels: `STAFF_DAY_OFF` → "Folga da equipe", `MAINTENANCE` → "Manutenção", `HOLIDAY` → "Feriado". Empty start/end = full-day (hint: "Vazio = bloqueio do dia inteiro").

Error messages (pt-BR):
- 409 overlap → "Já existe um bloqueio nesse período."
- 409 full-day vs partial → "Conflito com bloqueio parcial existente na mesma data."
- 422 past date → "Não é possível bloquear datas passadas."
- 201 + bookings exist (UC-010a A4) → non-blocking inline warning banner after close: "X agendamento(s) aprovado(s) existe(m) nesse período. Reagende ou cancele manualmente."

`apps/web/components/schedule/RemoveClosureDialog.tsx` — shadcn `<Sheet side="bottom">`, compact confirmation:
- Shows: reason label + formatted date + time range
- "Remover bloqueio" button — destructive red
- `DELETE /v1/schedule/closures/:id` → 204 → close sheet, remove from local state

`apps/web/components/schedule/OpeningFormSheet.tsx` — UC-010c:

| Field | Component | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `date` | `<Input type="date" readOnly>` | pre-filled from selected closed day |
| `startTime` | `<Input type="time">` | required |
| `endTime` | `<Input type="time">` | required; must be > `startTime` |
| `notes` | `<Textarea>` | optional; max 200 chars |

Error messages (pt-BR):
- 409 → "Já existe uma abertura para esta data."
- 422 past date → "Não é possível abrir datas passadas."
- 422 day already open → "Esse dia já está aberto nas configurações regulares. Ajuste os horários de funcionamento."

`apps/web/components/schedule/RemoveOpeningDialog.tsx` — same pattern as `RemoveClosureDialog`. "Remover abertura" — destructive. 204 → revert day to closed state.

`apps/web/lib/api/schedule.ts`:
```typescript
fetchClosures(params: { from: string; to: string }): Promise<{ closures: ScheduleClosure[] }>
createClosure(body: CreateClosureRequest): Promise<ScheduleClosure>
deleteClosure(id: string): Promise<void>
fetchOpenings(params: { from: string; to: string }): Promise<{ openings: ScheduleOpening[] }>
createOpening(body: CreateOpeningRequest): Promise<ScheduleOpening>
deleteOpening(id: string): Promise<void>
```
Approved bookings for the schedule grid reuse `fetchStaffBookings({ status: 'APPROVED', from, to })` from `lib/api/bookings-staff.ts` (`M13-S03`).

**BFF `.http` gaps (create in this story if missing):**
- `apps/bff/http/schedule/schedule-openings.http` — `POST` and `DELETE /v1/schedule/openings` request blocks
- `apps/bff/http/schedule/availability.http` — `GET /v1/schedule/availability/summary` request block

**`@ikaro/types` additions (new file or extend existing):**
```typescript
export interface ScheduleClosure {
  id: string;
  date: string;
  reason: 'STAFF_DAY_OFF' | 'MAINTENANCE' | 'HOLIDAY';
  startTime: string | null;
  endTime: string | null;
  notes: string | null;
}
export interface ScheduleOpening {
  id: string;
  date: string;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  notes: string | null;
}
export interface CreateClosureRequest {
  date: string;
  reason: 'STAFF_DAY_OFF' | 'MAINTENANCE' | 'HOLIDAY';
  startTime?: string;
  endTime?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
export interface CreateOpeningRequest {
  date: string;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] "Abrir dia especial" on a closed day → `OpeningFormSheet` with date read-only
- [ ] 201 → day shows opening window in grid
- [ ] 409/422 → pt-BR inline errors

*Remove opening (UC-010d):*
- [ ] Clicking opening block → `RemoveOpeningDialog`
- [ ] "Remover abertura" → 204 → day reverts to closed

*Layout:*
- [ ] BottomNav visible (top-level page)
- [ ] Horários item active in sidebar and bottom nav
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15 (shell), M13-S03 (`fetchStaffBookings` with APPROVED filter), M13-S17 (`WeekNav` component)

### M13-S22 — Serviços: service list page (`/dashboard/services`)

*(formerly M125-S08)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/01-servicos-list.html` (reference)

**Description:**
The main service management page — a filterable list of all services (active + inactive) with quick visual indicators and entry points to create or edit.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Check whether a `lib/api/dashboard/services.ts` fetcher file exists. If not, create it. Verify `apps/web/app/dashboard/` folder structure matches `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` — place the route at `/dashboard/services`.

**Prototype reference:** `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/01-servicos-list.html`
**Route:** `/dashboard/services`

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/services.ts`:
```typescript
fetchStaffServices(): Promise<StaffServiceListResponse>
// GET /v1/services, X-Actor-* headers forwarded, auth cookie
```

`apps/web/app/dashboard/services/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchStaffServices()`
- Renders `<ServiceListPage services={data.items} />`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/services/ServiceListPage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Filter tabs: **Todos** (N) | **Ativos** (N) | **Inativos** (N) — client-side filter, no re-fetch
- Service cards via `<ServiceCard>` — full list at mount; filtered array on tab change
- Empty state per tab: "Nenhum serviço cadastrado." / "Nenhum serviço ativo." / "Nenhum serviço inativo." (pt-BR)
- FAB (mobile `<1024px`): `+ Criar` → `/dashboard/services/new`; `bottom: 5rem` to clear bottom nav
- Desktop create button (`.topbar-create-btn` pattern — CSS `display:none` / `≥1024px display:inline-flex`): in topbar right area → `/dashboard/services/new`
- Sidebar/bottom-nav cross-links to Agenda/Horários/Fidelidade must point to their real routes (`/dashboard/bookings`, `/dashboard/schedule`, `/dashboard/loyalty`) — the journey-prototype audit found this is the one staff page whose sidebar links were already fully correct; keep it that way.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/services/ServiceCard.tsx`:
- Service name (bold)
- Meta row: duration · price (R$ formatted) · points (pts)
- Pickup badge (`🚗 Coleta`) when `requiresPickupAddress: true`
- Inactive service: `opacity: 0.55`; status chip "Inativo"
- Entire card is a link → `/dashboard/services/[id]/edit`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Page renders full list from `fetchStaffServices()`
- [ ] "Todos" tab shows all; "Ativos" shows only `isActive: true`; "Inativos" shows only `isActive: false`
- [ ] Tab counts update correctly when a service was just deactivated (stale data handled by Next.js `revalidatePath` from edit page)
- [ ] Inactive cards render at 55% opacity with "Inativo" chip
- [ ] Pickup badge visible only when `requiresPickupAddress: true`
- [ ] Empty state (zero services) shows pt-BR message, no JS error
- [ ] FAB visible on mobile, hidden on desktop; desktop create button visible on desktop, hidden on mobile
- [ ] Both entry points link to `/dashboard/services/new`
- [ ] Serviços item active in sidebar and bottom nav
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15 (shell), M13-S05 (BFF endpoints + types)

### M13-S23 — Serviços: create service page (`/dashboard/services/new`)

*(formerly M125-S09)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-012, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/02-service-create.html`, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/02b-service-create-error.html`, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/02c-service-create-success.html`

**Description:**
The service creation form. The prototype shows a clean single-page form with two toggles and inline validation for the duplicate-name 409 error, followed by a confirmation state on the list page.

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/02-service-create.html` — happy path
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/02b-service-create-error.html` — 409 duplicate name error state
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/02c-service-create-success.html` — post-create success state on the list page

> **AC addition folded in during consolidation:** the original draft of this story specified the redirect-to-list behavior but no explicit confirmation that creation succeeded — the journey-prototype audit found the list page had no success state at all. The prototype now has `02c-service-create-success.html` (list page + inline green banner confirming the new service); replicate that exact pattern below rather than a bare redirect.

**Route:** `/dashboard/services/new`

**`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/services.ts` additions:**
```typescript
createService(body: CreateServiceRequest): Promise<StaffServiceResponse>
// POST /v1/services → 201; 409 → duplicate name
```

**What to create:**

`apps/web/app/dashboard/services/new/page.tsx` — server component wrapper, renders `<ServiceCreatePage />`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/services/ServiceCreatePage.tsx` — `'use client'`:

| Field | Input | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Nome do serviço | `<input type="text">` | required; max 100 chars |
| Descrição | `<textarea>` | optional; max 500 chars |
| Preço | `<input type="number">` with R$ prefix | required; > 0 |
| Duração | `<input type="number">` with "min" suffix | required; integer > 0 |
| Pontos de fidelidade | `<input type="number">` | optional; integer ≥ 0; default 0 |
| Coleta e entrega | toggle (OFF by default) | maps to `requiresPickupAddress` |
| Criar como ativo | toggle (ON by default) | maps to `isActive` |

- Topbar: back arrow → `/dashboard/services` + title "Criar serviço"
- On submit: calls `createService()`
  - `201` → `router.push('/dashboard/services?created=1')` + `revalidatePath('/dashboard/services')` — the list page reads `?created=1` and renders the inline green success banner (per `02c-service-create-success.html`): "Serviço criado com sucesso!" above the list, with the new service visible in it
  - `409` duplicate name → name field gets error state (red border + `#fef2f2` bg) + error message "Já existe um serviço com este nome. Escolha outro nome." (exact text from prototype)
  - Other error → toast "Erro ao criar serviço. Tente novamente."
- Submit button disabled while submitting

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] All 5 fields + 2 toggles render; price shows R$ prefix, duration shows "min" suffix
- [ ] Validation: name required; price and duration must be > 0
- [ ] 201 → redirects to `/dashboard/services?created=1`; new service visible in list; inline green success banner shown once, matching `02c-service-create-success.html`
- [ ] 409 → name field highlighted (red border + light red bg); error message shown inline below field; other fields unchanged
- [ ] "Criar como ativo" toggle defaults to ON; "Coleta e entrega" defaults to OFF
- [ ] Submit button disabled during in-flight request
- [ ] Topbar back arrow returns to `/dashboard/services` without submit
- [ ] Bottom nav visible (mobile); Serviços item active
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15 (shell), M13-S05 (BFF endpoints + `CreateServiceRequest` type)

---

### M13-S24 — Serviços: edit + deactivate service (`/dashboard/services/[id]/edit`)

*(formerly M125-S10)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-013, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/03-service-edit.html`, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/03b-deactivate-confirm.html`

**Description:**
The service edit form (pre-filled, price-change warning, status badge in topbar) and the deactivation flow (danger zone → confirmation page → `DELETE /v1/services/:id`).

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/03-service-edit.html` — edit form
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/servicos/03b-deactivate-confirm.html` — deactivation confirmation

**Routes:** `/dashboard/services/[id]/edit` and `/dashboard/services/[id]/deactivate`

**`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/services.ts` additions:**
```typescript
fetchStaffService(serviceId: string): Promise<StaffServiceResponse>
// GET /v1/services/:id

updateService(serviceId: string, body: UpdateServiceRequest): Promise<StaffServiceResponse>
// PATCH /v1/services/:id → 200; 409 → duplicate name

deactivateService(serviceId: string): Promise<void>
// DELETE /v1/services/:id → 204
```

**What to create:**

`apps/web/app/dashboard/services/[id]/edit/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchStaffService(id)`; if not found → `notFound()`
- Renders `<ServiceEditPage service={data} />`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/services/ServiceEditPage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Topbar: back arrow → `/dashboard/services` + breadcrumb "Serviços" + title "Editar serviço" + status badge ("Ativo" green / "Inativo" grey)
- Same 5 fields as create, pre-filled from `service` prop; **no** `isActive` toggle — status is managed via deactivation flow only
- Price field shows inline warning `.form-warn`: "Só afeta novos agendamentos" (triangle icon, amber colour — exact text from prototype)
- On submit: calls `updateService()`
  - `200` → `router.push('/dashboard/services')` + `revalidatePath`
  - `409` → name field error state (same pattern as `M13-S23`)
  - Other error → toast
- **Danger zone** section (bottom of form, separated by red border-top):
  - Heading: "Zona de perigo"
  - Description: "Desativar este serviço impede novos agendamentos. Agendamentos existentes não são afetados."
  - Button: "Desativar serviço" (destructive style) → navigates to `/dashboard/services/[id]/deactivate`
  - Only shown when `service.isActive === true`

`apps/web/app/dashboard/services/[id]/deactivate/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchStaffService(id)` to populate the confirmation card; `notFound()` if missing or already inactive
- Renders `<ServiceDeactivatePage service={data} />`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/services/ServiceDeactivatePage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Topbar: back arrow → `/dashboard/services/[id]/edit` + "Editar serviço" breadcrumb + title "Desativar serviço"
- Service summary card: name + meta (duration · price · points)
- Warning box (amber border): three bullet impacts (hides from booking form / existing bookings unaffected / can be reactivated)
- "Confirmar desativação" button (red/destructive): calls `deactivateService()`
  - `204` → `router.push('/dashboard/services')` + `revalidatePath('/dashboard/services')`
  - Error → toast "Erro ao desativar. Tente novamente."
- "Cancelar" button → `router.back()`
- Bottom nav visible; Serviços item active

**Acceptance criteria:**

*Edit (UC-013 main flow):*
- [ ] Form pre-filled with current service data
- [ ] Price field shows amber inline warning "Só afeta novos agendamentos"
- [ ] `200` → redirects to list; updated service visible
- [ ] `409` → name field error inline; other fields unchanged
- [ ] Status badge in topbar reflects `isActive`

*Deactivate (UC-013 A1):*
- [ ] Danger zone visible only when `isActive: true`
- [ ] "Desativar serviço" navigates to `/dashboard/services/[id]/deactivate`
- [ ] Deactivation confirmation page shows service card + impact bullets
- [ ] `204` → redirects to list; service shown at 55% opacity with "Inativo" chip
- [ ] "Cancelar" returns to edit page without changes

*Layout:*
- [ ] Both pages: back arrow in topbar; bottom nav visible; Serviços active in nav
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15 (shell), M13-S05 (BFF endpoints + types), M13-S22 (`revalidatePath` target)

## Phase 6 — Staff loyalty frontend

---

### M13-S25 — Frontend: `/dashboard/loyalty` — customer search + loyalty detail pages

*(formerly M128-S03)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `plan/journey/staff/fidelidade.md`, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/fidelidade/dev-notes.md`

**Description:**
Two pages under a new `/dashboard/loyalty` route. The search page lets staff find any customer by name/email; the detail page shows their active balance (with currency equivalent), earning history tab (active vs. expired entries), and redemption history tab.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Confirm `M13-S12` has shipped: `GET /v1/customers?search=` and enriched balance response exist.
> - Check `apps/web/app/dashboard/` structure — place new route at `loyalty/`.
> - Confirm `apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/` convention (flat files or per-module folders).

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/fidelidade/00-customer-search.html`
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/fidelidade/01-customer-loyalty.html`
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/fidelidade/01b-no-entries.html`
- `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/fidelidade/01c-no-results.html`

---

**`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/loyalty.ts`:**
```typescript
searchCustomers(term: string): Promise<CustomerSearchListResponse>
// GET /v1/customers?search=:term&limit=20

fetchCustomerLoyaltyBalance(customerId: string): Promise<EnrichedLoyaltyBalanceResponse>
// GET /v1/customers/:customerId/loyalty/balance

fetchCustomerLoyaltyEntries(customerId: string, page?: number): Promise<PaginatedLoyaltyEntriesResponse>
// GET /v1/customers/:customerId/loyalty/entries?page=:page&limit=20

fetchCustomerLoyaltyRedemptions(customerId: string, page?: number): Promise<PaginatedLoyaltyRedemptionsResponse>
// GET /v1/customers/:customerId/loyalty/redemptions?page=:page&limit=20
```

---

**`apps/web/app/dashboard/loyalty/page.tsx`** — server component:
- Reads `searchParams.customerId` (optional)
- If no `customerId`: renders `<LoyaltySearchPage />`
- If `customerId` present: fetches balance + entries + redemptions in parallel (`Promise.all`), renders `<CustomerLoyaltyPage balance={...} entries={...} redemptions={...} />`
- 404 if `customerId` given but backend returns 404

**`apps/web/components/dashboard/loyalty/LoyaltySearchPage.tsx`** — `'use client'`:
- Search input with debounce (300ms)
- On empty: "Clientes recentes" — `GET /v1/customers?search=&limit=5` (most recent, sorted by last booking date)
- On search: live results as user types
- Each result row: avatar (initials), name, email, `currentPoints` badge; entire row → `router.push('/dashboard/loyalty?customerId=:id')`
- No results state (per `01c-no-results.html`)

**`apps/web/components/dashboard/loyalty/CustomerLoyaltyPage.tsx`** — `'use client'` (manages tab state):
- Customer header: avatar + name + email
- **Balance card** (blue gradient per prototype):
  - `currentPoints` (large number)
  - If `nextExpiryDate`: amber inline strip "X pts expiram em DD MMM YYYY"
  - `conversionRate > 0`: "N pts = R$1 · Valor total: R$ X"
  - `conversionRate === 0`: no conversion line (feature disabled)
- **Tab bar**: "Histórico de ganhos" | "Resgates"
- **Earnings tab** (`LoyaltyEntryItem[]`): sorted `earnedAt DESC`; active entries normal weight; expired entries `opacity: 0.45` with "expirado" badge; "+N pts" right-aligned in green
- **Redemptions tab** (`LoyaltyRedemptionItem[]`): `redeemedAt DESC`; each row shows pts redeemed, amount saved, linked booking ref when `bookingId` present; "−N pts" right-aligned in red
- "Carregar mais" button per tab when `total > items.length` (calls fetcher with `page + 1`, appends results)
- **Zero entries state** (per `01b-no-entries.html`): muted balance card (grey) + "Nenhum ponto acumulado ainda"

**Validation (per SonarCloud rules):**
```typescript
interface Props {
  readonly balance: EnrichedLoyaltyBalanceResponse;
  readonly entries: PaginatedLoyaltyEntriesResponse;
  readonly redemptions: PaginatedLoyaltyRedemptionsResponse;
}
```

**Testing:** `app/**/page.tsx` — no unit tests (Playwright E2E). No Vitest tests needed for this story.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /dashboard/loyalty` renders search input + "Clientes recentes" list
- [ ] Typing in search field debounces 300ms and updates results
- [ ] No results for unknown term → "Nenhum cliente encontrado" empty state
- [ ] Clicking a customer row navigates to `/dashboard/loyalty?customerId=:id`
- [ ] Balance card shows `currentPoints`, expiry strip (when `nextExpiryDate != null`), conversion line (when `conversionRate > 0`)
- [ ] "Histórico de ganhos" tab: active entries normal, expired at 45% opacity with badge
- [ ] "Resgates" tab: each redemption shows pts, amount saved, booking ref (when present)
- [ ] "Carregar mais" appends next page without replacing current results
- [ ] Zero entries state renders without JS error
- [ ] Fidelidade item active in sidebar navigation
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S12, M13-S15 (dashboard shell + sidebar Fidelidade nav item — already included from the start per `M13-S15`'s fix note)

---

### M13-S26 — Frontend: loyalty strip in `MarkCompleteSheet` (UC-009 A6)

*(formerly M128-S04)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-009 A6, `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/04-mark-complete.html`

**Description:**
Extends the `MarkCompleteSheet` component (built in `M13-S20`) with the loyalty redemption strip. Visible only when `booking.customerId != null` AND `conversionRate > 0`. Staff enters points to use (or clicks "Usar todos"), sees the BRL discount live, and the discount is included in the completion request body.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Confirm `M13-S20` shipped `MarkCompleteSheet`. Read it in full before adding anything.
> - Confirm `StaffBookingDetailResponse` (from `M13-S04`) includes `loyaltyBalance: number | null` and `loyaltyConversionRate: number` (added per `M13-S04`'s note, sourced from `M13-S12`).
> - Read `apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/bookings.ts` `completeBooking()` fetcher — confirm it accepts `CompleteBookingRequest` from `@ikaro/types` and that `discountByPoints` is now in the type (added in `M13-S12`).

**Prototype reference:** `plan/journey/staff/prototypes/agenda/04-mark-complete.html` (loyalty strip section)

**What to add to `MarkCompleteSheet`:**

Condition: `props.loyaltyBalance !== null && props.loyaltyBalance > 0 && props.conversionRate > 0`

If condition is false (guest booking or feature disabled): loyalty strip not rendered.

**`LoyaltyRedemptionStrip` component** (inline or separate file):

```
Props:
  availablePoints: number          // booking.loyaltyBalance
  conversionRate: number           // points_per_currency_unit
  linesTotalAmount: number         // live sum of actualPriceCharged across lines
  onChange: (discount: { pointsUsed: number; amountDeducted: number } | null) => void
```

Layout (per prototype):
- Blue-tinted card section
- Header: "João tem N pontos disponíveis" + pts badge + "= R$X" hint
- Input: `[____] pts = R$ X` (live conversion as user types) + "Usar todos" button
- Validation:
  - `pointsUsed ≤ availablePoints`
  - `amountDeducted = Math.floor(pointsUsed / conversionRate)`
  - Cap: `amountDeducted` cannot exceed `linesTotalAmount` (discount ≤ booking total)
- When `pointsUsed > 0`: discount row appears below the lines total: "Desconto fidelidade (N pts): − R$X"
- Final total = `linesTotalAmount - amountDeducted`

**`MarkCompleteSheet` state additions:**
```typescript
discountByPoints: { pointsUsed: number; amountDeducted: number } | null
```

On confirm: pass `discountByPoints` to `completeBooking()` fetcher.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Loyalty strip not rendered for guest bookings (`loyaltyBalance === null`)
- [ ] Loyalty strip not rendered when `conversionRate === 0`
- [ ] Points input accepts integer values; "Usar todos" fills maximum valid amount
- [ ] `amountDeducted` live-updates as user types points
- [ ] Discount is capped at lines total (cannot go below R$0)
- [ ] Discount row appears in the totals section when `pointsUsed > 0`
- [ ] On confirm: `completeBooking()` called with `discountByPoints` when points are applied
- [ ] On confirm: `completeBooking()` called without `discountByPoints` when strip is unused
- [ ] Completion success banner shows loyalty discount row when discount was applied
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S20 (base `MarkCompleteSheet`), M13-S12 (`CompleteBookingRequest` type with `discountByPoints`)

---

## Phase 7 — Customer Minha Conta

> **Discovery note (applies to this entire phase):** Several BFF endpoints were built in M08/M09 for guest/admin flows and may already serve the CUSTOMER role. Every story that touches the BFF (already covered in Phase 1's `M13-S06`–`M13-S08`) had a "🔍 Discover before starting" callout. Read the existing controller before writing new code — the story scope may have shrunk to type additions only.

### M13-S27 — Minha Conta home + booking list page (`/{slug}/minha-conta`)

*(formerly M126-S03)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-006, UC-016
**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/shared/customer-dashboard.html` — Início tab (stat cards + upcoming preview)
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/01-minha-conta.html` — Agendamentos tab (3 sections)
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/01b-minha-conta-empty.html` — empty state

**Description:**
The customer's home — a single route with two tab views. The "Início" tab shows summary stats and a preview of upcoming/pending bookings. The "Agendamentos" tab shows the full sectioned list. Both views are rendered client-side from the same server-fetched data.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Confirm that `CustomerBookingListResponse` and `CustomerLoyaltyBalanceResponse` from `M13-S06` are available in `packages/types/`. Verify `apps/web/lib/api/` — check whether a customer fetcher file already exists (`customer.ts`, `minha-conta.ts`). Follow the convention already in place.

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/minha-conta.ts`:
```typescript
fetchCustomerBookings(): Promise<CustomerBookingListResponse>
// GET /v1/bookings — no status filter; all statuses returned, split client-side
// Sends auth cookie + X-Actor-* headers

fetchLoyaltyBalance(): Promise<CustomerLoyaltyBalanceResponse>
// GET /v1/loyalty/balance
```

`apps/web/app/[slug]/minha-conta/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchCustomerBookings()` and `fetchLoyaltyBalance()` in parallel (`Promise.all`)
- On fetch error → render error boundary (not a crash)
- Renders `<MinhaContaPage bookings={items} loyaltyBalance={balance} />`

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/MinhaContaPage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Manages `activeTab: 'inicio' | 'agendamentos'` state (default: `'inicio'`)
- Syncs active tab to the shell's tab nav + bottom nav (via props or context)
- Renders `<InicioDashboard>` or `<AgendamentosList>` based on active tab

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/InicioDashboard.tsx`:
- Greeting: "Olá, {userName}"
- Stat cards: **Pontos** (`currentPoints`) + **Agendamentos** (`total`)
- Loyalty expiry strip: "X pontos expiram em {nextExpiryDate}" — hidden when `nextExpiryDate` is null
- Upcoming preview: up to 3 most recent APPROVED or PENDING/INFO_REQUESTED bookings as `<BookingListItem>` rows
- "Ver todos os agendamentos →" link → switches to `'agendamentos'` tab
- "+ Novo agendamento" CTA (mobile) → `/{slug}/booking`

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/AgendamentosList.tsx`:
- **Client-side section split** (from one `items` array):
  ```ts
  const upcoming = items.filter(b => b.status === 'APPROVED' && new Date(b.scheduledAt!) >= today);
  const pending  = items.filter(b => b.status === 'PENDING' || b.status === 'INFO_REQUESTED');
  const history  = items.filter(b => ['COMPLETED','CANCELLED','REJECTED'].includes(b.status));
  ```
- Loyalty compact strip at top (points + expiry)
- Three labeled sections with section count badges
- Each section: list of `<BookingListItem>` rows; empty section → section hidden (not empty state)
- All sections empty → `<BookingEmptyState>` (UC-006 A1)

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/BookingListItem.tsx`:
- Service name(s), date + time, total price, status badge
- For APPROVED: "Cancelar" text link (visible only within cancellation window — UC-006 A2) + links to detail page
- For INFO_REQUESTED: "Responder" text link + status badge (blue)
- For PENDING: "Cancelar solicitação" text link + status badge (yellow)
- For COMPLETED/CANCELLED/REJECTED: read-only, badge only, no action links

**Cancellation window check (UC-006 A2) — client-side:**
```ts
// tenantSettings.booking.cancellation_window_hours loaded from JWT or BFF
const deadline = new Date(booking.scheduledAt!);
deadline.setHours(deadline.getHours() - cancellationWindowHours);
const canCancel = new Date() < deadline;
// canCancel === false → hide "Cancelar" link; show note "Prazo encerrado"
```

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/BookingEmptyState.tsx` — UC-006 A1:
- Icon + "Nenhum agendamento ainda"
- CTA "Fazer agendamento" → `/{slug}/booking`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Page fetches both endpoints in parallel; renders within 2 network round trips
- [ ] Início tab: stat cards show `currentPoints` and `total`; loyalty expiry strip visible when `nextExpiryDate != null`
- [ ] Agendamentos tab: Próximos / Pendentes / Histórico sections contain correct items per status logic
- [ ] Empty sections are hidden; all three empty → `<BookingEmptyState>` shown
- [ ] "Cancelar" on APPROVED item: visible when `now < scheduledAt − windowHours`; hidden with "Prazo encerrado" note otherwise
- [ ] INFO_REQUESTED item shows "Responder" link (not "Cancelar")
- [ ] Status badges match tokens.css: `.status-approved`, `.status-pending`, `.status-info`, `.status-cancelled`
- [ ] Completed items: no action links
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings
- [ ] Vitest unit test for the client-side section-split logic (pure function)

**Dependencies:** M13-S16, M13-S06

### M13-S28 — Booking detail page + cancel flow + info submit (`/{slug}/minha-conta/agendamentos/[id]`)

*(formerly M126-S05)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-006 step 5, UC-007, UC-005 A2
**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/02-agendamento-detail.html` — APPROVED detail
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/02b-agendamento-info-requested.html` — INFO_REQUESTED + response form
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/02c-agendamento-historico.html` — COMPLETED read-only
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/03-cancel-confirm.html` — cancel confirmation page
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/03b-cancel-error.html` — outside window error

**Description:**
The booking detail page for a customer. The page adapts based on status: APPROVED/PENDING show a cancel action; INFO_REQUESTED shows an info-submit form; COMPLETED/CANCELLED/REJECTED are read-only. Cancel confirmation is a dedicated sub-page (not a JS overlay — static prototype informed this decision).

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Confirm `CustomerBookingDetailResponse` from `M13-S07` is available in types. Check `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` for `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/cancel` and `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/submit-info` — verify both accept CUSTOMER role and return the expected shapes. Check `tenants.settings.booking.cancellation_window_hours` is accessible from the JWT or a BFF settings endpoint; if not, default to `48`.

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/minha-conta.ts` (extend from `M13-S27`):
```typescript
fetchCustomerBookingDetail(bookingId: string): Promise<CustomerBookingDetailResponse>
// GET /v1/bookings/:id

cancelBooking(bookingId: string): Promise<void>
// PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/cancel
// 200 → booking now CANCELLED
// 422 → outside window (UC-007 A1)

submitInfo(bookingId: string, message: string): Promise<void>
// PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/submit-info  { message }
// 200 → booking status returns to PENDING
```

`apps/web/app/[slug]/minha-conta/agendamentos/[id]/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchCustomerBookingDetail(id)`
- `notFound()` on 404; `redirect('/{slug}/login')` on 401/403
- Renders `<AgendamentoDetailPage booking={data} cancellationWindowHours={windowHours} />`

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/AgendamentoDetailPage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Topbar: `← Agendamentos` back link + status badge (updates after action)
- Renders `<AgendamentoDetailMain>` (read-only booking info)
- Conditionally renders:
  - `<CancelAction>` when status is APPROVED (within window) or PENDING/INFO_REQUESTED
  - `<InfoSubmitForm>` when status is INFO_REQUESTED and no `infoResponseMessage` yet
  - Nothing extra when COMPLETED/CANCELLED/REJECTED

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/AgendamentoDetailMain.tsx` — read-only body:
- Date + time section
- Service lines table: name | duration | price; totals row
- "Suas observações" section: `booking.notes` — hidden when null
- Before-service photos grid (lazy loaded) — hidden when empty array
- After-service photos grid (COMPLETED only) — hidden when empty
- Loyalty points earned banner (COMPLETED only — show if `afterServicePhotoUrls.length > 0` or status COMPLETED)

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/CancelAction.tsx`:
- "Cancelar agendamento" button → navigates to `/{slug}/minha-conta/agendamentos/[id]/cancelar`
- Window note: "Cancelamento gratuito até {deadline}" — shown for APPROVED within window

`apps/web/app/[slug]/minha-conta/agendamentos/[id]/cancelar/page.tsx` — server component:
- Renders `<CancelConfirmPage booking={...} />`

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/CancelConfirmPage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Shows booking summary + warning
- "Confirmar cancelamento" → calls `cancelBooking()`
  - 200 → redirect to `/{slug}/minha-conta` (booking will appear as CANCELLED in Histórico)
  - 422 → redirect to `/{slug}/minha-conta/agendamentos/[id]/cancelar/erro` (UC-007 A1)
- "Voltar" → `router.back()`

`apps/web/app/[slug]/minha-conta/agendamentos/[id]/cancelar/erro/page.tsx`:
- Renders `<CancelErrorPage>` — static (no action needed, just shows error + "Voltar" + a real `wa.me` WhatsApp contact link, not a placeholder `href="#"` — see `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/03b-cancel-error.html`, fixed during the journey-prototype audit to use the tenant's contact number)

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/InfoSubmitForm.tsx` — UC-005 A2:
- Shows `infoRequestMessage` (admin's question) in a blue info box
- Textarea for response (required) — error message "Informe sua resposta antes de enviar." when empty
- "Enviar resposta" → calls `submitInfo()`
  - 200 → local state update: hide form, show "Resposta enviada" confirmation, status badge → PENDING
  - Error → inline error message; form stays open

**Bottom nav:** hidden on all detail and cancelar pages (drill-down pages — add `<style>.bottom-nav { display: none !important; }</style>` in layout or `page.tsx`).

**Acceptance criteria:**

*Detail page:*
- [ ] APPROVED detail: shows date, services, notes, cancel button (when within window), before-photos
- [ ] INFO_REQUESTED detail: shows admin's question + `<InfoSubmitForm>`
- [ ] COMPLETED detail: shows after-photos, loyalty points banner, "Fazer novo agendamento" CTA; no cancel button
- [ ] CANCELLED/REJECTED detail: read-only, no action buttons
- [ ] Bottom nav hidden (drill-down)

*Cancel flow (UC-007):*
- [ ] "Cancelar" → navigates to `/cancelar` page showing booking summary + warning
- [ ] "Confirmar cancelamento" → `PATCH /cancel` → 200 → redirect to minha-conta list
- [ ] `PATCH /cancel` 422 → redirect to `/cancelar/erro` with "Prazo encerrado" message + working WhatsApp contact link

*Info submit (UC-005 A2):*
- [ ] INFO_REQUESTED booking shows `infoRequestMessage` + textarea form
- [ ] Submit disabled when textarea empty
- [ ] 200 → form replaced with "Resposta enviada" confirmation; status badge updates to PENDING
- [ ] Network error → inline error; form remains usable

*Types:*
- [ ] `cancelBooking`, `submitInfo` fetchers in `apps/web/lib/api/minha-conta.ts`
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

### M13-S29 — Frontend: Fidelidade page (`/{slug}/minha-conta/fidelidade`)

*(formerly M126-S07)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-016, `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/04-fidelidade.html` — full view with tabs
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/04b-fidelidade-empty.html` — 0 pts empty state

**Description:**
The customer's own loyalty history page — a full view of their balance, earning entries, and redemption history. Accessed by tapping the loyalty strip on the Minha Conta home page or the "Fidelidade" tab in the nav bar.

> **Dependency fix applied during consolidation:** the original draft listed this story's data dependencies as just the balance + entries/redemptions BFF calls (`M13-S06`, `M13-S08`), which would have let it ship before the loyalty conversion-rate field existed — its own "10 pts = R$ 1,00" conversion row would have had nothing real to read. `M13-S12` (which adds `conversionRate` to the balance response) is now an explicit dependency; since `M13-S12` is in Phase 1, it's already satisfied by the time this phase starts.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Confirm `M13-S08` types (`CustomerLoyaltyEntriesResponse`, `CustomerLoyaltyRedemptionsResponse`) are in `packages/types/`.
> - Confirm `CustomerLoyaltyBalanceResponse` from `M13-S06` (including `conversionRate` from `M13-S12`) is available.
> - Check `apps/web/lib/api/minha-conta.ts` — extend it rather than creating a new file.
> - The "10 pts = R$ 1,00" conversion row's UI was carried over from the prototype with only an inline comment caveat — the journey-prototype audit flagged it should be explicitly verified against UC-016's actual MVP scope (CLAUDE.md describes the loyalty MVP as points-balance only). Confirm with product before shipping the conversion row as-is; it is gated on `conversionRate > 0` either way, so tenants with redemption disabled never see it.

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/minha-conta.ts` (extend from `M13-S27`):
```typescript
fetchLoyaltyEntries(limit?: number): Promise<CustomerLoyaltyEntriesResponse>
// GET /v1/loyalty/entries?limit=50

fetchLoyaltyRedemptions(limit?: number): Promise<CustomerLoyaltyRedemptionsResponse>
// GET /v1/loyalty/redemptions?limit=50
```

`apps/web/app/[slug]/minha-conta/fidelidade/page.tsx` — server component:
- Calls `fetchLoyaltyBalance()`, `fetchLoyaltyEntries()`, `fetchLoyaltyRedemptions()` in parallel
- Renders `<MinhaFidelidadePage balance={...} entries={...} redemptions={...} conversionRate={...} />`

`apps/web/components/customer/minha-conta/MinhaFidelidadePage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- **Balance card** (gradient blue — same pattern as `04-fidelidade.html`):
  - `currentPoints` (large bold number)
  - "pontos ativos" label
  - Expiry strip: "X pts expiram em {date}" — hidden when `nextExpiryDate === null`
  - Conversion row: "10 pts = R$ 1,00 · Valor total: R$ {currentPoints / rate}" — hidden when `conversionRate === 0`
- **Tab bar**: "Histórico de ganhos" | "Resgates"
- **Ganhos tab**: list of `CustomerLoyaltyEntryResponse` rows
  - Service name + date + `+N pts` (green)
  - Expired entries: `opacity: 0.4`, "Expirado" badge, `+N pts` grey
- **Resgates tab**: list of `CustomerLoyaltyRedemptionResponse` rows
  - Description + date + `−N pts` (red) + "Economia: R$ X,XX"
  - Empty resgates: "Nenhum resgate realizado ainda"
- **Empty state** (when `currentPoints === 0 && entries.total === 0`):
  - Muted balance card (0, low opacity)
  - "Nenhum ponto acumulado ainda" + CTA "Agendar agora" → `/{slug}/booking`
- Vitest unit test: `MinhaFidelidadePage.spec.tsx` — key cases: renders balance, tabs switch correctly, empty state shown when both entries and balance are zero

**`CustomerShell` update** (`M13-S16`):
- "Fidelidade" tab nav link (desktop) and bottom-nav item (mobile) must link to `/{slug}/minha-conta/fidelidade`
- Loyalty strip on Minha Conta home (`01-minha-conta.html`) is a link → this page

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /{slug}/minha-conta/fidelidade` renders balance card with `currentPoints`
- [ ] Expiry strip visible when `nextExpiryDate != null`; hidden otherwise
- [ ] Conversion row visible when `conversionRate > 0`; hidden otherwise
- [ ] Ganhos tab: entries shown with service name, date, green `+N pts`; expired entries faded
- [ ] Resgates tab: redemptions shown with `−N pts` and savings amount; empty message when list is empty
- [ ] Empty state (0 pts, no entries): muted balance card + "Agendar agora" CTA
- [ ] "Fidelidade" nav tab active on this page (both desktop and mobile)
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings
- [ ] Vitest unit tests pass

**Dependencies:** M13-S16 (shell), M13-S06 (`fetchLoyaltyBalance`), M13-S08 (entries + redemptions BFF), M13-S12 (`conversionRate` enrichment)

### M13-S30 — Frontend: UC-023 tenant switch trigger + page

*(formerly M126-S08)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts` (frontend) + `bff-ts` (one new BFF endpoint)
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-023, `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `plan/M03-AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS_IA.md`
**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/minha-conta/05-trocar-empresa.html` — same visual pattern as `/select-tenant`
- `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/login/01-select-tenant.html` — reference for card pattern

**Description:**
Completes UC-023: a logged-in customer who belongs to multiple tenants can switch their active tenant from the avatar dropdown in the customer shell. The BFF already issues a new cookie-set JWT on `POST /v1/auth/switch-tenant` (fixed in `M13-S02`); this story adds the tenant-list endpoint and the UI.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Confirm `M13-S02` is deployed: `POST /v1/auth/switch-tenant` sets the `access_token` httpOnly cookie and returns `{ tenantSlug, expiresIn }`.
> - Check `apps/bff/src/customers/customers.controller.ts` — does `GET /v1/customers/tenants` exist? If not, it must be added (see BFF part below).
> - Check `apps/web/app/switch-tenant/page.tsx` — this is separate from `/select-tenant` (login flow). Same visual, different endpoint and context.
> - In the JWT payload, check if `tenantCount` or a list of tenant IDs is included. If not, the frontend must always call the BFF endpoint (cannot short-circuit based on JWT alone).

**BFF part — `GET /v1/customers/tenants` (if missing):**

Add to `apps/bff/src/customers/customers.controller.ts`:
```typescript
@Get('tenants')
@Roles('CUSTOMER')
getCustomerTenants(
  @CurrentUser() user: CurrentUserPayload,
): Promise<TenantOption[]> {
  // Calls GET /internal/customers/{user.sub}/tenants
  // Excludes the current tenant (user.tenantId) from the returned list
  // Returns TenantOption[] (same type used by /select-tenant)
}
```

`TenantOption` is already in `@ikaro/types` (added in `M13-S02`). Confirm it contains: `{ id, name, slug, loyaltyPoints }`. If `loyaltyPoints` is not available from the internal tenant endpoint, call `GET /internal/customers/{customerId}/loyalty-balance?tenantId={id}` per tenant or set to `0` for now (note the limitation in dev-notes).

**`@ikaro/types` addition** (if not already in `M13-S02`):
```typescript
// packages/types/src/auth.dto.ts
export interface SwitchTenantRequest {
  readonly targetTenantId: string;
}
// SwitchTenantResponse already defined in M13-S02: { tenantSlug, expiresIn }
```

**Frontend part:**

`apps/web/lib/api/auth.ts` (extend from `M13-S14`):
```typescript
fetchCustomerTenants(): Promise<TenantOption[]>
// GET /api/customers/tenants — returns other tenants (current excluded)

switchTenant(targetTenantId: string): Promise<SwitchTenantResponse>
// POST /api/auth/switch-tenant { targetTenantId }
// BFF sets httpOnly cookie; returns { tenantSlug }
```

`apps/web/app/switch-tenant/page.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Same visual layout as `plan/journey/customer/prototypes/login/01-select-tenant.html` (centered, full height, Ikaro logo, tenant cards)
- On mount: calls `fetchCustomerTenants()`
  - Loading: skeleton cards
  - Empty (customer has only 1 tenant): redirect to `/{currentSlug}/minha-conta` (should not reach this page)
- Shows current tenant first, marked "Atual" (non-clickable) — read `tenantSlug` from JWT cookie to identify current
- Other tenant cards: clickable → calls `switchTenant(targetTenantId)` → on success `router.push('/{newSlug}')` → cookie updated → hotsite refreshes as logged-in customer of new tenant
- `"← Voltar sem trocar"` link at bottom → `router.back()`
- Error (network failure on switch): inline alert "Não foi possível trocar de empresa. Tente novamente." + retry button

`CustomerShell` update (in `apps/web/components/customer/CustomerShell.tsx`):
- Avatar dropdown: add "Trocar empresa" item between "← Site Ikaro" and "Sair" links
- **Only render this item when customer has 2+ tenants.** Detection: call `fetchCustomerTenants()` on mount of CustomerShell (or include tenant count in JWT payload if available). If the call returns an empty list → do not render the "Trocar empresa" item.
- "Trocar empresa" links to `/switch-tenant`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /v1/customers/tenants` (CUSTOMER JWT) returns list of tenants excluding current; each with name, slug, loyaltyPoints
- [ ] Tenant isolation: Customer A cannot retrieve Customer B's tenant list
- [ ] "Trocar empresa" item visible in avatar dropdown when `fetchCustomerTenants()` returns at least 1 item
- [ ] "Trocar empresa" item hidden when customer has only 1 tenant
- [ ] `GET /switch-tenant` renders current tenant (marked "Atual") + other tenants as cards
- [ ] Clicking another tenant calls `POST /api/auth/switch-tenant` + redirects to `/{newSlug}` on success
- [ ] New tenant's hotsite renders in logged-in state (cookie updated)
- [ ] Network error on switch → inline alert + retry; no navigation
- [ ] `"← Voltar sem trocar"` navigates back without switching
- [ ] `.http` block added for `GET /v1/customers/tenants`
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S02 (switch-tenant cookie fix), M13-S14 (`TenantOption` type + `/select-tenant` visual pattern), M13-S16 (CustomerShell exists)

---

## Phase 8 — Manager workspace

> **Discovery note (applies to this entire phase):** Equipe and Hotsite were confirmed fully backend+BFF-ready by direct code inspection on 2026-06-16 — `GET /staff` already returns active+inactive members, and Hotsite already has every CRUD/publish/image-upload route it needs. Configurações was the exception (no GET endpoint existed for tenant settings) — that gap is already closed by `M13-S09`/`M13-S10` in Phase 1, so by the time this phase starts, all three sub-areas have their backend/BFF readiness in place.

---

### M13-S31 — Configurações: settings form page (`/dashboard/settings`)

*(formerly M127-S03, folds in M128-S05)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** L
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-026, `plan/journey/manager/configuracoes.md`, `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/configuracoes/dev-notes.md`

**Description:**
The settings form — five sections matching the prototype: Geral, Agendamento, Fidelidade, Horário de funcionamento, Contato. Scope is exactly what's in the prototype and UC-026 — the backend supports additional fields (`auto_approve_enabled`, `slot_granularity_minutes`, `localization`, etc.) that are **explicitly out of scope** here; see the consolidated open-questions section at the end of this file.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Confirm the exact `TenantSettingsResponse`/`UpdateTenantSettingsRequest` field names against what `M13-S10`/`M13-S12` actually shipped — don't build the form against the UC text or this plan's draft shape, the landed BFF types are the source of truth.

**Prototype reference:** `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/configuracoes/01-settings-form.html` (happy path), `01b-validation-error.html`, `01c-saved-success.html`

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/settings.ts`:
```typescript
fetchTenantSettings(): Promise<TenantSettingsResponse>
updateTenantSettings(body: UpdateTenantSettingsRequest): Promise<TenantSettingsResponse>
```

`apps/web/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` — server component: calls `fetchTenantSettings()`, renders `<SettingsForm initial={data} />`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/settings/SettingsForm.tsx` — `'use client'`, five section cards per the prototype:

| Section | Fields |
|---|---|
| Geral | `name` (editable), `slug` (read-only — gray background, `disabled` input) |
| Agendamento | `cancellationWindowHours` (0–720, suffix "horas"), `serviceBufferMinutes` (0–120, suffix "min") |
| Fidelidade | `loyaltyExpiryDays` (1–3650, suffix "dias"), **`pointsPerCurrencyUnit`** (integer 0–10000, label "Pontos por unidade monetária" — see note below) |
| Horário de funcionamento | `timezone` select + 7 day-rows (open/close time pickers + "Fechado" checkbox per day) |
| Contato | `phone`, `email`, `address` (street/number/complement/neighborhood/city/state/zipCode) — all optional |

> **Field folded in during consolidation (formerly a separate story, M128-S05):** `pointsPerCurrencyUnit` is added directly to the Fidelidade section here rather than as a follow-up story that would touch this same file again right after it ships. Hint text: "Quantos pontos equivalem a 1 unidade monetária (ex: 10 = 10 pts → R$1). Zero desativa o desconto por pontos." Value `0` is accepted (disables the feature); `> 10000` shows inline validation error "Máximo 10000". The field is included in `UpdateTenantSettingsRequest` as of `M13-S12`.

- `SettingsFormSchema` (Zod) mirrors the backend's validation ranges exactly (see table in dev-notes.md)
- On submit: `200` → inline toast "Configurações salvas com sucesso." (stays on page, no redirect — matches `01c-saved-success.html`); `422` → the offending field gets `has-error` styling + inline message, other fields keep their values (matches `01b-validation-error.html`)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Form loads pre-filled from `fetchTenantSettings()`
- [ ] `slug` is read-only and visually distinct from editable fields
- [ ] All five sections render with exactly the fields listed above (including `pointsPerCurrencyUnit`) — no more, no less
- [ ] Submitting `cancellationWindowHours > 720` shows an inline error on that field only; other field values are preserved
- [ ] `pointsPerCurrencyUnit` accepts `0`; rejects `> 10000` with inline error "Máximo 10000"; save sends it in the PATCH body
- [ ] Successful save shows a toast and the user stays on `/dashboard/settings`
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S10, M13-S15 (shell + manager-only route guard — see `M13-S32`'s note on extending the middleware), M13-S12 (`pointsPerCurrencyUnit` in `UpdateTenantSettingsRequest`)

---

### M13-S32 — Equipe: team list page (`/dashboard/team`)

*(formerly M127-S04)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-028, UC-029; `plan/journey/manager/equipe.md`; `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/equipe/dev-notes.md`

**Description:**
The team list with Ativo / Convite pendente / Inativo filter tabs. The data model has no dedicated "pending invite" status — both a never-activated invitee and a deactivated former member have `isActive: false`. The list must derive the displayed status client-side.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** `GET /staff` (BFF) already exists and returns a `StaffListResponse` (`apps/bff/src/staff/staff.controller.ts`) — confirm via `apps/bff/src/staff/staff.types.ts` whether each list item exposes `googleOAuthId` or `deactivatedBy`. If neither is exposed, this story must add one of them to the BFF response (a small addition here, not a new story) — without it, "Convite pendente" vs. "Inativo" cannot be computed. Also reconcile: `packages/types/src/staff.dto.ts`'s `StaffResponse` differs slightly from the BFF's local `staff.types.ts` shapes — per CLAUDE.md's `@ikaro/types` scope rule (BFF→Frontend contract only), confirm `apps/web` should import from `@ikaro/types`, and align the BFF's local type with it if they've drifted.

**Prototype reference:** `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/equipe/01-team-list.html`
**Route:** `/dashboard/team`

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/team.ts`:
```typescript
fetchTeam(): Promise<StaffListResponse>
// GET /staff, auth cookie + X-Actor-* headers
```

`apps/web/app/dashboard/team/page.tsx` — server component: calls `fetchTeam()`, renders `<TeamListPage members={data.items} currentStaffId={jwt.sub} />`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/team/TeamListPage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Filter tabs: **Todos** | **Ativos** | **Convites pendentes** | **Inativos** — client-side filter on the derived status, no re-fetch
- `memberStatus(member)` helper (per dev-notes.md):
  ```typescript
  function memberStatus(m: StaffListItem): 'active' | 'pending' | 'deactivated' {
    if (m.isActive) return 'active';
    return m.googleOAuthId === null ? 'pending' : 'deactivated';
  }
  ```
- The logged-in admin's own row (`member.staffId === currentStaffId`) never renders a "Desativar" action (server-side guard already exists via `StaffSelfDeactivationError`; this is the UX nicety, not the safety net)
- A `pending` row shows "Reenviar convite" instead of "Desativar" — reopens the invite form (`M13-S33`) pre-filled with the same email
- Desktop create button + mobile FAB → `/dashboard/team/invite`

`apps/web/components/dashboard/team/MemberRow.tsx`:
- Avatar (initials) + name + email
- Role badge (`Gerente` / `Equipe`)
- Status badge (`Ativo` green / `Convite pendente` yellow / `Inativo` red)
- Action: "Desativar" → `/dashboard/team/[id]/deactivate`, or "Reenviar convite" for pending rows, or nothing for the current user's own row

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] List loads from `fetchTeam()`, renders all four filter tabs with correct counts
- [ ] Status badge correctly distinguishes Ativo / Convite pendente / Inativo using the `memberStatus()` heuristic
- [ ] The current admin's own row has no "Desativar" action
- [ ] A pending row's action is "Reenviar convite", not "Desativar"
- [ ] Create entry points (FAB mobile, button desktop) link to `/dashboard/team/invite`
- [ ] Page is `MANAGER`-only — `STAFF` role hitting `/dashboard/team` redirects (extend `M13-S15`'s middleware: add `/dashboard/team`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/hotsite` to the manager-only route list — coordinate this as one shared middleware change across `M13-S31`/`M13-S32`/`M13-S35`, not three separate edits)
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15

### M13-S33 — Equipe: invite member form (`/dashboard/team/invite`)

*(formerly M127-S05)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-028, `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/equipe/02-invite-form.html`, `02b-invite-error.html`

**Description:**
The invite form — name, email, role selector. `POST /staff/invite` already exists and is fully guarded; this is a frontend-only story.

**Route:** `/dashboard/team/invite`

**`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/team.ts` additions:**
```typescript
inviteStaff(body: InviteStaffRequest): Promise<InviteStaffResponse>
// POST /staff/invite -> 201; 409 -> email already has an active record
```

**What to create:**

`apps/web/app/dashboard/team/invite/page.tsx` — server component wrapper, renders `<InviteForm />`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/team/InviteForm.tsx` — `'use client'`:

| Field | Input | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Nome | `<input>` | required |
| Sobrenome | `<input>` | required |
| E-mail | `<input type="email">` | `z.email()` |
| Função | card-select: Equipe / Gerente | required, defaults to "Equipe" |

- Topbar: back arrow → `/dashboard/team`
- On submit: `inviteStaff({ firstName, lastName, email, role })`
  - `201` → `router.push('/dashboard/team')` + `revalidatePath('/dashboard/team')` + toast "Convite enviado para [email]."
  - `409` → email field gets `has-error` styling + "Este e-mail já está cadastrado na sua equipe." (matches `02b-invite-error.html`); other fields unchanged
  - Inactive record with same email (UC-028 A2) → backend reactivates silently; same `201` success path, no special handling needed client-side
- Submit disabled while in flight

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] All 4 fields render; role selector defaults to "Equipe"
- [ ] `201` → redirects to `/dashboard/team`; new member visible with "Convite pendente" status
- [ ] `409` → email field shows inline error; first/last name and role selection are preserved
- [ ] Back arrow returns to `/dashboard/team` without submitting
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S32

### M13-S34 — Equipe: deactivate member flow

*(formerly M127-S06)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-029, `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/equipe/03-deactivate-confirm.html`, `03b-deactivate-self-error.html`, `03c-deactivate-lastmanager-error.html`

**Description:**
The deactivation confirmation flow, including the two business-rule error states already enforced server-side: self-deactivation (`403`) and last-active-MANAGER (`409`). `PATCH /staff/:id/deactivate` already exists with both guards implemented in `DeactivateStaffUseCase` — frontend-only story.

**Route:** `/dashboard/team/[id]/deactivate`

**`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/team.ts` additions:**
```typescript
deactivateStaff(staffId: string): Promise<DeactivateStaffResponse>
// PATCH /staff/:id/deactivate -> 200; 403 self; 409 last manager
```

**What to create:**

`apps/web/app/dashboard/team/[id]/deactivate/page.tsx` — server component: looks up the member from the already-fetched team list (or a single `GET /staff/:id` call — confirm which is cheaper at discovery), renders `<DeactivateConfirmPage member={data} />`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/team/DeactivateConfirmPage.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Member summary card: avatar + name + email + role
- Warning box: 3 bullets (loses access immediately / past actions stay in history / can be re-invited later) — matches `03-deactivate-confirm.html`
- "Confirmar desativação" (`btn-danger`) → calls `deactivateStaff()`
  - `200` → `router.push('/dashboard/team')` + `revalidatePath('/dashboard/team')`; member now shows "Inativo"
  - `403` → render `<SelfDeactivationError>` inline (matches `03b-deactivate-self-error.html`, using the `detail-layout`/`detail-aside` grid like `03-deactivate-confirm.html` for visual consistency) — should be unreachable via normal navigation since `M13-S32` hides the action on the admin's own row, but the page must still handle it defensively
  - `409` → render `<LastManagerError>` inline (matches `03c-deactivate-lastmanager-error.html`, same grid pattern)
- "Cancelar" → `router.back()`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Confirmation page shows the correct member's summary card
- [ ] `200` → redirects to `/dashboard/team`; member now shows "Inativo" status
- [ ] `403` → inline error matching `03b-deactivate-self-error.html`'s copy exactly: "Você não pode desativar sua própria conta."
- [ ] `409` → inline error matching `03c-deactivate-lastmanager-error.html`'s copy exactly: "O estabelecimento precisa de pelo menos um gerente ativo."
- [ ] "Cancelar" returns to the previous page without calling the API
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

### M13-S35 — Hotsite: editor shell + Branding tab

*(formerly M127-S07)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** L
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-027, `plan/journey/manager/hotsite.md`, `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/hotsite/dev-notes.md`

**Description:**
The Hotsite editor page itself — tabbed shell (Branding / Layout / SEO, client-side tab state, no separate routes, matching the prototype) — plus the Branding tab's full field set. `GET`/`PATCH /tenants/hotsite` and the image signed-URL endpoint already exist and are fully typed in `@ikaro/types` (`packages/types/src/hotsite.ts`) — frontend-only story. Branding scope is the 13-field set agreed during the audit (2026-06-16), not the original 4-field UC-027 text.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Confirm `HotsiteAdminContentResponse`'s exact branding field names in `packages/types/src/hotsite.ts` before building the form. Confirm whether an `UpdateHotsiteContentRequest` TS interface already exists alongside the BFF's `UpdateHotsiteContentBodySchema` Zod schema, or only the Zod schema exists on the BFF side — if the frontend has nothing to import, add the missing TS interface to `packages/types/src/hotsite.ts` as part of this story (small addition, not a new story). Also check `POST /tenants/hotsite/images/signed-url`'s exact request/response shape (`GenerateHotsiteImageSignedUrlResponse`) before wiring the logo upload.

**Prototype references:**
- `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/hotsite/01-hotsite-editor.html` — shell + Branding tab
- `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/hotsite/01b-color-error.html` — invalid hex color (UC-027 A1)
- `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/hotsite/01c-image-upload-fallback.html` — upload failure → URL fallback (UC-027 A2)

**Route:** `/dashboard/hotsite`

**What to create:**

`apps/web/lib/api/dashboard/hotsite.ts`:
```typescript
fetchHotsiteConfig(): Promise<HotsiteAdminContentResponse>
updateHotsiteConfig(body: UpdateHotsiteContentRequest): Promise<HotsiteAdminContentResponse>
requestImageUploadUrl(fileName: string, contentType: string): Promise<GenerateHotsiteImageSignedUrlResponse>
```

`apps/web/app/dashboard/hotsite/page.tsx` — server component: calls `fetchHotsiteConfig()`, renders `<HotsiteEditor initial={data} />`.

`apps/web/components/dashboard/hotsite/HotsiteEditor.tsx` — `'use client'`:
- Tab state: `'branding' | 'layout' | 'seo'` (client-side only, matches prototype's `showTab()`)
- Holds the full draft config in local state; `M13-S36`/`M13-S37` extend this same component with the Layout/SEO tab bodies and the Preview/Publish actions
- "Publicar alterações" button always visible regardless of active tab — calls `updateHotsiteConfig()` then `POST /tenants/hotsite/publish` (full publish flow wired in `M13-S37`; this story stubs the button disabled until `M13-S37` lands, or implements just the `PATCH` half — confirm sequencing at discovery)

`apps/web/components/dashboard/hotsite/BrandingTab.tsx` — grouped into 4 sub-sections (Cores, Logo, Tipografia, Forma e estilo), per the prototype:

| Sub-section | Fields |
|---|---|
| Cores | `primaryColor`, `secondaryColor`, `backgroundColor`, `textColor` (hex inputs + swatch), `buttonBackgroundColor`, `buttonTextColor` (optional) |
| Logo | upload area → `requestImageUploadUrl()` + direct PUT to signed URL; on failure, falls back to a plain URL text input (UC-027 A2) |
| Tipografia | `headingFontFamily`, `bodyFontFamily` (select) |
| Forma e estilo | `borderRadius` (sharp/rounded/pill), `buttonStyle` (filled/outline/ghost), `spacing` (compact/comfortable/spacious), `shadowStyle` (none/subtle/strong) — pill-button selects |

- Hex color fields validate client-side (`/^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$/`) before allowing save; invalid → inline error "Cor inválida. Use o formato hexadecimal, ex: #2563eb." (matches `01b-color-error.html`)
- Group the four sub-sections' container styling into a shared `.section-card`/`.section-card-title`/`.section-card-sub` pattern — these are now promoted to `plan/journey/shared/tokens.css` (the journey-prototype audit found this exact pattern duplicated identically across the Configurações and Hotsite prototypes and promoted it), so the frontend implementation should mirror that with one reusable component/style block rather than per-field bespoke styling.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Editor loads with 3 tabs; Branding active by default; switching tabs doesn't trigger a network request
- [ ] All 13 branding fields render, grouped into the 4 sub-sections above
- [ ] Invalid hex color shows inline error and blocks save
- [ ] Logo upload failure shows the URL fallback input (simulate by forcing the upload call to reject)
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S15, M13-S32 (shared middleware extension for manager-only routes — or land independently if `M13-S32` hasn't merged yet; confirm at discovery to avoid a circular dependency)

---

### M13-S36 — Hotsite: Layout tab (module toggle/reorder + Hero config)

*(formerly M127-S08)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-027 Section B, `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/hotsite/01-hotsite-editor.html` (Layout tab), `01d-module-config-hero.html`

**Description:**
Extends `HotsiteEditor` (`M13-S35`) with the Layout tab — the 7-module toggle/reorder list, plus a per-module config drill-down. **Only the HERO module's config panel is in scope here**; the other 6 (`SERVICE_LIST`, `GALLERY`, `BOOKING_CTA`, `TESTIMONIALS`, `ABOUT`, `CONTACT`) are explicitly deferred — see the consolidated open-questions section at the end of this file.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Decide how "Configurar" should present the per-module panel — modal, slide-over, or a full route. The prototype doesn't mandate one; pick whichever the rest of the dashboard already establishes a precedent for (check if Phase 4/5 introduced a `Sheet`/`Dialog` pattern) and reuse it rather than inventing a new interaction.

**What to create:**

`apps/web/components/dashboard/hotsite/LayoutTab.tsx`:
- Renders the 7 modules in `layout` array order, each row: drag handle, module name (pt-BR label), "Configurar" link, enabled/disabled toggle
- Drag-to-reorder updates the local `layout` array order (no network call until "Publicar alterações")
- "Configurar" is only wired for HERO in this story; for the other 6 modules render the link disabled with a tooltip "Em breve" rather than a broken link

`apps/web/components/dashboard/hotsite/modules/HeroConfigPanel.tsx`:
- Fields: `title` (required), `subtitle` (optional), layout (`centered`/`left-aligned`), CTA target (`booking`/`service-list`), optional background image (reuses the same signed-URL upload pattern as the Logo field in `M13-S35`)
- "Aplicar" commits the draft back into `HotsiteEditor`'s local state (no network call — persisted only on "Publicar alterações")

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Layout tab renders all 7 modules in their current order with working enabled/disabled toggles
- [ ] Drag-to-reorder changes the local order (verify via a subsequent publish round-trip, not just visually)
- [ ] "Configurar" on Hero opens `HeroConfigPanel` pre-filled with current values
- [ ] "Configurar" on the other 6 modules is visibly disabled, not a dead link
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S35

### M13-S37 — Hotsite: SEO tab + Preview + Publish/Unpublish

*(formerly M127-S09)*

**Agent:** `frontend-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Docs to load:** `docs/04-USE_CASES.md` § UC-027 Section C, `plan/journey/manager/prototypes/hotsite/02-preview.html`, `03-publish-success.html`, `03b-unpublish-success.html`

**Description:**
Closes out the Hotsite editor: the SEO tab, the Preview action, and the Publish/Unpublish actions.

> **Preview fidelity note (validated in the journey-prototype pass):** the prototype originally rendered its preview mock with a hardcoded `--ba-primary` value regardless of the form's edited color — meaning the "preview" never actually reflected what was being edited. This was fixed at the prototype level with a lightweight `localStorage`-based live-binding (`01-hotsite-editor.html` writes the draft color on input/navigate; `02-preview.html` reads it on load) purely to validate the UX. **The production implementation must not reuse that mechanism** — bind the preview to actual component state (the same `draft` object `HotsiteEditor` already holds in memory), not `localStorage`. The underlying engineering question (does the preview need a BFF preview-token for a pixel-exact production-path render, or is a client-side draft render sufficient?) is still open — this story picks the pragmatic v1 answer (client-side render of the draft state) rather than building the more involved BFF preview-token approach; revisit if stakeholders need a pixel-exact production-path preview.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:** Confirm whether the hotsite's public-facing render components (`HeroModule`, `ServiceListModule`, etc. from M12) can be imported directly into the dashboard bundle to render the draft preview, or whether they have server-only dependencies that block client-side reuse. If they can't be reused directly, scope down to a simplified mock preview for v1 and flag the gap rather than building a parallel render path.

**What to create:**

`apps/web/components/dashboard/hotsite/SeoTab.tsx`:
- `title` (text, maxlength 70, optional) — hint: "Deixe em branco para usar o título gerado automaticamente"
- `description` (textarea, maxlength 160, optional) — same fallback hint

`apps/web/components/dashboard/hotsite/HotsitePreview.tsx`:
- Renders the draft config using the M12 hotsite module components directly (if reusable per discovery) with a sticky banner: "Visualizando alterações não publicadas" + "Voltar a editar" / "Publicar agora" actions
- Reads color/branding values directly from `HotsiteEditor`'s in-memory `draft` state (passed as a prop) — NOT from `localStorage` or any other out-of-band channel (see preview fidelity note above)
- Opened from the editor's "Preview" button — overlay or new route, confirm at discovery

**`HotsiteEditor` (`M13-S35`) additions:**
- "Publicar alterações": `updateHotsiteConfig(draft)` → `200` → `POST /tenants/hotsite/publish` → `200` → toast "Hotsite atualizado e no ar." (matches `03-publish-success.html`)
- Danger-zone "Despublicar hotsite": `POST /tenants/hotsite/unpublish` → `200` → toast confirming the hotsite is offline (matches `03b-unpublish-success.html`)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] SEO fields enforce their max lengths and show a live character counter
- [ ] "Preview" renders the draft state (not the last-published state) without requiring a save first, sourced from in-memory state
- [ ] "Publicar alterações" persists the draft, publishes, and shows the success toast
- [ ] "Despublicar hotsite" is visually separated in a danger-zone section and requires no extra confirmation step beyond the click itself (matches prototype — no confirmation dialog was prototyped for this action; flag if product wants one added)
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes; `pnpm lint` zero warnings

**Dependencies:** M13-S35, M13-S36

## Phase 9 — Guest submit-info

> This phase is a fully independent vertical slice — it touches no dashboard code and could in principle be built anytime after M08. It's sequenced last purely because it's the smallest, most isolated piece, not because anything in Phases 1–8 blocks it.

> **Deployment constraint — `M13-S38` must ship in the same deployment as `M13-S40`:** `M13-S38` renames the email link from `/bookings/:id/responder` to `/bookings/:id/submit-info`. If `M13-S38` ships without `M13-S40`, new emails will link to a 404. If `M13-S40` ships without `M13-S38`, the page exists but no email links to it. Ship them together. Existing emails (already sent, pointing to `/responder`) will 404 after `M13-S38` — acceptable given the 7-day token TTL.

---

### M13-S38 — Backend: rename email link URL (`responder` → `submit-info`)

*(formerly M129-S01)*

**Agent:** `backend-ts`
**Complexity:** XS (2 files, ~3 line changes)
**Must co-deploy with:** M13-S40
**Docs to load:** none beyond this file

**Description:**
The info-request email currently links guests to `/bookings/:id/responder?token=`. The new frontend page lives at `/bookings/:id/submit-info`. Update the link builder and its spec.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> Read `apps/backend/src/contexts/notification/application/use-cases/send-booking-info-requested-notification/send-booking-info-requested-notification.use-case.ts` in full.
> Confirm `buildRespondLink()` is the only place this path is constructed — grep the entire `apps/backend/` for `responder` to find any other occurrences.

**File 1:** `apps/backend/src/contexts/notification/application/use-cases/send-booking-info-requested-notification/send-booking-info-requested-notification.use-case.ts`

Change in `buildRespondLink()`:
```ts
// Before:
return `${frontendUrl}/bookings/${dto.bookingId}/responder?token=${token}`;
// After:
return `${frontendUrl}/bookings/${dto.bookingId}/submit-info?token=${token}`;
```

**File 2:** `apps/backend/src/contexts/notification/application/use-cases/send-booking-info-requested-notification/send-booking-info-requested-notification.use-case.spec.ts`

Update the assertion that checks the constructed link. Grep for `responder` in the spec — replace with `submit-info`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `buildRespondLink()` emits `/submit-info` for guest path; authenticated path unchanged (`/dashboard/bookings/${id}`)
- [ ] All existing spec assertions pass with updated URL expectation
- [ ] `grep -r "responder" apps/backend/src/contexts/notification/` returns zero matches

**Dependencies:** M08

### M13-S39 — BFF: guest booking read endpoint (optional — enhances M13-S40)

*(formerly M129-S02)*

**Agent:** `bff-ts`
**Complexity:** S
**Optional:** `M13-S40` can ship without this. Without it, the form shows no booking summary card (graceful degradation). Implement if time allows — it meaningfully improves UX.
**Docs to load:** `docs/24-BFF_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/14-API_CONTRACTS.md` (bookings section), `plan/M08-BOOKING-APPROVAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS_IA.md`

**Description:**
Add `GET /v1/bookings/:id/guest?token=` to the BFF — a `@Public()` endpoint that validates the guest token and returns the minimal booking fields needed to pre-fill the form (service name, date, info request message). Without this, the frontend form has no way to show a booking summary to the guest.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> Read `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` — locate `submitInfoGuest()` (the existing `@Public()` PATCH handler). **Understand how it derives tenant context** without a `X-Tenant-Slug` header (TenantGuard is bypassed by `@Public()`). Whatever mechanism it uses to call the backend with the correct tenant must be replicated for this GET endpoint. Read `apps/bff/src/shared/http/backend-http.service.ts` to understand how the BFF passes headers to the backend.
>
> Also check: does `apps/backend/src/contexts/booking/infrastructure/controllers/booking.controller.ts` have a guest-accessible `GET /bookings/:id` variant? Or does the existing `GET /bookings/:id` work without authentication at the backend level (since the BFF validates the token and the backend relies on `X-Internal-Key`)?

**Endpoint:**
```
GET /v1/bookings/:id/guest?token=<JWT>
@Public()

Response 200:
{
  bookingId: string;
  status: "INFO_REQUESTED";           // if not INFO_REQUESTED → 409
  serviceSummary: string;             // e.g. "Lavagem Simples"
  scheduledAt: string;                // ISO-8601
  infoRequestMessage: string;         // what the admin asked for
  contactName: string;
}

Response 400: token missing or invalid JWT
Response 401: token bookingId ≠ path :id (mismatch)
Response 409: booking is not INFO_REQUESTED (already processed)
Response 404: booking not found
```

**Token validation:** reuse the existing `verifyGuestToken()` function already in the BFF bookings controller. Do not duplicate logic.

**Zod schema (response):**
```ts
export const GuestBookingReadResponseSchema = z.object({
  bookingId: z.uuid(),
  status: z.literal('INFO_REQUESTED'),
  serviceSummary: z.string(),
  scheduledAt: z.string(),
  infoRequestMessage: z.string(),
  contactName: z.string(),
});
export type GuestBookingReadResponse = z.infer<typeof GuestBookingReadResponseSchema>;
```

**`.http` file:** add a request block to `apps/bff/http/bookings/bookings.http`:
```http
### UC-005 A2 — Guest reads booking summary before submitting info
GET {{bffUrl}}/v1/bookings/{{bookingId}}/guest?token={{guestToken}}
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Returns 200 with booking summary fields when token is valid and booking is `INFO_REQUESTED`
- [ ] Returns 400 when `?token=` is absent or JWT signature is invalid
- [ ] Returns 401 when token `bookingId` ≠ path `:id`
- [ ] Returns 409 when booking status ≠ `INFO_REQUESTED`
- [ ] No `X-Tenant-Slug` or JWT auth cookie required
- [ ] `.http` block added
- [ ] Unit test covers: valid token, invalid token, mismatched bookingId, wrong status

**Dependencies:** M08

### M13-S40 — Frontend: `SubmitInfoPage` + `SubmitInfoForm`

*(formerly M129-S03)*

**Agent:** `web-ts`
**Complexity:** M
**Must co-deploy with:** M13-S38; M13-S39 optional (degrade gracefully if absent)
**Docs to load:** `docs/16-DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `plan/M12-HOTSITE-FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS_IA.md`
**Prototype:** `plan/journey/guest/prototypes/submit-info/` — read `dev-notes.md` in full before starting

**Description:**
Create the standalone public page that guests arrive at via the info-request email link. No authentication required. The page validates the guest token server-side, optionally fetches the booking summary, and renders a form for the guest to type their response and optionally upload photos.

> 🔍 **Discover before starting:**
> - Confirm `apps/web/app/bookings/` does NOT exist yet — this is a new top-level Next.js route.
> - Read `apps/web/app/[slug]/booking/page.tsx` to understand the existing public booking page pattern (auth bar, fetch pattern, error states).
> - Confirm that `jsonwebtoken` is already a dependency in `apps/web/package.json`. If not, add `jose` instead (Web Crypto API, works in Edge Runtime — `jsonwebtoken` requires Node.js runtime).
> - Read `apps/bff/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` — locate `SubmitGuestBookingInfoBodySchema` (lines ~109–121) to confirm the exact body shape: `{ response: string, photoUrls?: string[] }`.
> - Check if `POST /v1/bookings/:id/presigned-url/guest?token=` exists in the BFF. If it does not exist, **omit photo upload from this story** — text-only response is sufficient for MVP. Document the gap in a comment.

**New files to create:**

| File | Notes |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/app/bookings/[id]/submit-info/page.tsx` | Server component — token validation + data fetch |
| `apps/web/components/booking/SubmitInfoForm.tsx` | Client component — form state machine |
| `apps/web/components/booking/SubmitInfoForm.spec.tsx` | Vitest + `@testing-library/react` unit tests |

---

#### `apps/web/app/bookings/[id]/submit-info/page.tsx` (server component)

```ts
// @vitest-environment jsdom  ← NOT here (this is a server component, not tested directly)
import { SubmitInfoForm } from '@/components/booking/SubmitInfoForm';

interface Props {
  params: { id: string };
  searchParams: { token?: string };
}

export default async function SubmitInfoPage({ params, searchParams }: Props) {
  const { token } = searchParams;

  // 1. Token presence check
  if (!token) {
    return <InvalidLinkView reason="missing" />;
  }

  // 2. Token signature + expiry validation (server-side)
  const payload = verifyGuestToken(token); // returns null on failure
  if (!payload || payload.bookingId !== params.id) {
    return <InvalidLinkView reason="invalid" />;
  }

  // 3. Optional: fetch booking summary (if M13-S39 shipped)
  const summary = await fetchGuestBookingSummary(params.id, token).catch(() => null);
  // If summary?.status is not INFO_REQUESTED → render InvalidLinkView with reason="processed"

  return (
    <SubmitInfoForm
      bookingId={params.id}
      token={token}
      summary={summary}  // null if M13-S39 not available
    />
  );
}
```

**`verifyGuestToken(token: string)`** — implement inline or as a shared util in `apps/web/lib/auth/guest-token.ts`:
- Use `jose` (`jwtVerify`) or `jsonwebtoken` (`jwt.verify`) with `process.env.JWT_SECRET`
- Payload shape: `{ bookingId: string, tenantId: string, contactEmail: string }`
- Return `null` on any error (expired, invalid signature, malformed)

**`fetchGuestBookingSummary(id, token)`** — in `apps/web/lib/api/bookings.ts`:
```ts
// GET /v1/bookings/:id/guest?token=
// Returns GuestBookingReadResponse | null (null if endpoint not found or 409)
```

---

#### `apps/web/components/booking/SubmitInfoForm.tsx` (client component)

**Props:**
```ts
interface SubmitInfoFormProps {
  readonly bookingId: string;
  readonly token: string;
  readonly summary: {
    readonly serviceSummary: string;
    readonly scheduledAt: string;
    readonly infoRequestMessage: string;
    readonly contactName: string;
  } | null;
}
```

**State machine:**
```
idle → submitting → success
              └──→ error (retry available, form values preserved)
```

**BFF call (submission):**
```
PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/submit-info/guest?token=<token>
  Body: { response: string, photoUrls?: string[] }
  No Authorization header, no X-Tenant-Slug
  Response 200: { bookingId, status: "PENDING", infoSubmittedAt }
```

**Validation (client-side before submit):**
| Field | Rule | Error message |
|---|---|---|
| `response` | `trim().length >= 1` | "Informe sua resposta antes de enviar." |

**Screens to implement** (from prototype):
| Screen | File | State |
|---|---|---|
| Form (idle) | `01-submit-form.html` | default render |
| Submitting | `01c-submitting.html` | button disabled + spinner |
| Validation error | `01d-validation-error.html` | field red border + inline error |
| Submit error | `01e-submit-error.html` | red alert + retry button, values preserved; also covers the token-expired-mid-flow case (a 401 from the `PATCH` after the page already rendered the form) — the journey-prototype dev-notes call out this specific path: swap the retry CTA for a link back to the invalid-link state instead, since retrying an expired token just 401s again |
| Success | `02-success.html` | replaces form in-place (no navigation) |
| Invalid link | `01b-invalid-link.html` | rendered by page.tsx before form mounts |

**Photo upload (MVP scope: text-only):**
```ts
// TODO: photo upload requires presigned-url endpoint for guests
// POST /v1/bookings/:id/presigned-url/guest?token= — verify this exists before implementing
// If missing: omit the upload zone; add a comment explaining the gap
```
If the presigned-URL endpoint does not exist, render a static note: _"Para enviar fotos, responda diretamente a este email com os arquivos em anexo."_

**Routing note (add as code comment):**
```ts
// This page lives at apps/web/app/bookings/[id]/submit-info/page.tsx
// Next.js static segment 'bookings/' takes priority over [slug]/ — no conflict.
// No auth required: page is fully public, token is the only access control.
```

---

#### `apps/web/components/booking/SubmitInfoForm.spec.tsx`

```ts
// @vitest-environment jsdom
```

**Minimum test cases:**
| Test | What to assert |
|---|---|
| renders form with summary card | `serviceSummary` and `infoRequestMessage` appear in DOM |
| renders form without summary | no summary card, form still functional |
| submit with empty response | field error message appears; no fetch called |
| submit success | success banner appears; form hidden |
| submit network error | error alert appears; retry button visible; response field value preserved |
| submit in progress | button disabled; spinner present |

Use `vi.mock` for `fetch`. Do NOT test `page.tsx` — server component, Playwright only.

---

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /bookings/[id]/submit-info?token=<valid>` renders the form (with or without summary)
- [ ] `GET /bookings/[id]/submit-info` (no token) renders the invalid-link screen
- [ ] `GET /bookings/[id]/submit-info?token=<expired>` renders the invalid-link screen
- [ ] Empty response field shows inline validation error; no API call made
- [ ] Successful submit shows success screen in-place; does not navigate
- [ ] Network error shows retry alert; form values preserved
- [ ] A 401 mid-submission (expired token detected only after the PATCH) shows the same submit-error layout but swaps the CTA to point back to the invalid-link state, not a same-token retry
- [ ] Button disabled + spinner during submission
- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test --filter apps/web`)
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` zero errors
- [ ] No `[slug]/` route captures `/bookings/` — verify by opening `localhost:3000/bookings/some-id/submit-info?token=test` and confirming it does not render the hotsite

**Dependencies:** M13-S38 (must co-deploy), M13-S39 (optional)

## Phase Pre-0 — Playwright E2E infrastructure

---

### M13-S41 — Playwright E2E infrastructure + guest booking golden path

> **Implement this story first** — before M13-S01. Every other M13 story that builds a `page.tsx` route must add an E2E test file alongside it (`apps/web/e2e/<feature>.spec.ts`). This scaffolding must exist before those stories start.

**Goal:** Install Playwright in `apps/web`; write the first E2E test for the UC-001 guest booking golden path (M12-S07 already built the code — this adds the test). Establish the convention: every `app/**/page.tsx` route added in M13 ships with a Playwright test in the same story.

**Convention for the rest of M13:**
Server component pages (`app/**/page.tsx`) cannot be Vitest-tested. From this story forward, every M13 story that ships a page must include a corresponding `apps/web/e2e/<feature>.spec.ts` covering the happy path. The guest booking test below is the template.

---

**Files to create/modify:**
- `apps/web/package.json` — add `@playwright/test` devDep + `e2e` / `e2e:ui` / `e2e:ci` scripts
- `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`
- `apps/web/e2e/guest-booking.spec.ts`
- Booking form components (M12-S07) — add `data-testid` attributes where missing (see below)
- `sonar-project.properties` — add `apps/web/e2e/**` to `sonar.exclusions`
- `.gitignore` — add `apps/web/playwright-report/` and `apps/web/test-results/`

---

**`apps/web/playwright.config.ts`:**
```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL ?? 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
  ],
  // webServer intentionally omitted — tests run against the already-running dev stack
  // (docker-compose up + pnpm dev). CI startup is M16-S06's scope.
});
```

---

**`data-testid` attributes** — add to M12-S07 booking form components if not already present:

| Element | Locator strategy |
|---|---|
| Service card (Step 1) | `data-testid="service-card"` |
| Day button in availability carousel | `data-testid="day-option"` + native `disabled` attr when unavailable |
| Time slot button | `data-testid="time-slot"` |
| Name input | `getByLabel(/nome/i)` — label already exists, no testid needed |
| Phone input | `getByLabel(/telefone/i)` — label already exists, no testid needed |
| Submit button (Step 4) | `getByRole('button', { name: /confirmar/i })` |
| Success message container | `data-testid="booking-success"` |

---

**`apps/web/e2e/guest-booking.spec.ts`:**
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('UC-001 — Guest booking golden path', () => {
  test('guest navigates from hotsite to booking form and submits successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Hotsite renders
    await page.goto('/ikaro');
    await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.locator('#service-list')).toBeVisible();

    // Navigate to booking form
    await page.goto('/ikaro/booking');
    await expect(page.locator('#booking-form')).toBeVisible();

    // Step 1 — select first available service
    await page.locator('[data-testid="service-card"]').first().click();
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: /próximo/i }).click();

    // Step 2 — pick first available day then first slot
    await page.locator('[data-testid="day-option"]:not([disabled])').first().click();
    await page.locator('[data-testid="time-slot"]').first().click();
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: /próximo/i }).click();

    // Step 3 — personal info
    await page.getByLabel(/nome/i).fill('E2E Teste');
    await page.getByLabel(/telefone/i).fill('11999999999');
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: /próximo/i }).click();

    // Step 4 — submit
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: /confirmar/i }).click();
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="booking-success"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

**Precondition (dev only):** `docker-compose up` + `pnpm dev` in `apps/web`. The seeded `ikaro` tenant must have at least one active service and available slots on future dates. If seeds don't cover this, add the missing rows in `seed.ts`.

---

**`pnpm` scripts to add to `apps/web/package.json`:**
```json
"e2e": "playwright test",
"e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
"e2e:ci": "playwright test --reporter=list"
```

---

**SonarCloud — `sonar-project.properties`:**
Add `apps/web/e2e/**` to the existing `sonar.exclusions` line.

**`.gitignore` additions:**
```
apps/web/playwright-report/
apps/web/test-results/
```

---

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `@playwright/test` added to `apps/web` devDependencies; `npx playwright install chromium` run once locally
- [ ] `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` created as above
- [ ] `apps/web/e2e/guest-booking.spec.ts` created; test passes locally against running dev stack and seeded `ikaro` tenant
- [ ] Booking form components have `data-testid` attributes as listed above
- [ ] `pnpm e2e` from `apps/web/` executes and the guest booking test passes
- [ ] `sonar-project.properties` updated: `apps/web/e2e/**` added to `sonar.exclusions`
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated with Playwright artifact paths
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` zero errors (Playwright types resolve correctly)
- [ ] Seeded `ikaro` tenant has an active service with available future slots (verify or patch `seed.ts`)

**Dependencies:** M12-S07 (guest booking form already built), M06-S04 (public services endpoint), M07-S04 (availability endpoint)

**Estimated size:** S

## Open questions & future discovery

> Consolidated from all 7 source files' "Open questions" and "Future discovery" sections. Items already resolved by a decision made during this consolidation (or that turned out to already be in scope) are marked `[x]` with a one-line resolution; genuinely open items are marked `[ ]` and reference the story they block.

### Auth (Phase 1–2, M13-S02/M13-S13/M13-S14)

- [ ] **BFF API route prefix in `apps/web`:** is auth called via `/api/auth/...` (Next.js API route proxy) or directly as `/v1/auth/...` (direct BFF call)? Verify before `M13-S13`/`M13-S14`. Check `next.config.js` rewrites or `apps/web/app/api/` route handlers.
- [ ] **Selection token decode strategy:** does `issueSelectionToken` encode the tenant list (decode on frontend) or only `{ googleOAuthId }` (requires a separate BFF `GET /auth/tenants?token=...` endpoint)? If the endpoint is missing, add it to `M13-S02`'s scope. Resolve before `M13-S14`.
- [ ] **`TenantOption.primaryColor`:** does the BFF selection token carry the tenant's `primaryColor`? If yes, include the field and use it for the initial avatar background in `/select-tenant`. If no, use a neutral placeholder.
- [x] **Post-login redirect from customer area:** confirmed — the customer lands on `/{slug}` (the hotsite), which already reads the `access_token` cookie server-side (M12) and shows the logged-in nav bar. No follow-up story needed.
- [ ] **Staff login Google button href prefix:** `/api/auth/google` (Next.js proxy) or `/v1/auth/google` (direct BFF)? Must match what the BFF OAuth callback `redirectUri` expects. Resolve before `M13-S13` AC sign-off.
- [ ] **Staff logout:** no logout endpoint designed yet. Current MVP behavior: JWT expiry → redirect to `/dashboard/login`. An explicit logout button is post-MVP — not scoped in any story above.
- [ ] **"Bem-vindo(a)!" first-login banner (UC-025 step 8):** would need the BFF to append `?welcome=1` to the `/dashboard` redirect, and the dashboard to render a one-time dismissible banner. Not scoped in any story above — fold into `M13-S15` or a follow-up patch if product wants it.
- [ ] **Playwright E2E suite for auth flows:** login flows need full E2E coverage (M16-S06). Playwright infrastructure is set up in M13-S41; the Google OAuth test-bypass endpoint required for automated auth testing is M16's scope.

### Staff booking core (Phase 4, M13-S17–M13-S20)

- [x] **Does the admin stay on the detail page after approve, or navigate back to the queue?** Resolved — stays, inline banner, manual "Voltar à agenda" link. Confirmed as the system-wide convention for approve/reject/info/cancel/complete/reschedule alike (see `M13-S18`/`M13-S19`/`M13-S20`'s descriptions).
- [ ] **Slot conflict suggestions source:** should the backend's `409` response body already include suggested alternate slots, or does the BFF need to call availability separately and compose them? Resolve before `M13-S18`.
- [ ] **Photo URL strategy:** GCS signed read URLs generated by the BFF at detail-fetch time, or a Next.js image proxy? M115-S01's pattern used signed URLs — recommend the same here (already assumed in `M13-S04`/`M13-S18`/`M13-S20`).
- [ ] **Real-time queue updates:** polling interval vs. WebSocket — two staff members might view the same booking simultaneously. Not scoped in `M13-S17`; decide at a Phase-4 retrospective, don't add silently.

### Customer Minha Conta (Phase 7, M13-S27–M13-S30)

- [ ] **`cancellation_window_hours` availability:** is this value accessible to the frontend without a dedicated settings endpoint? MVP default is to hardcode `48` and read from real settings later (used by `M13-S27`/`M13-S28`).
- [ ] **"Total washes completed" stat (UC-006 step 6):** not available from `GET /v1/loyalty/balance`. Drop from MVP Minha Conta, or derive client-side from `items.filter(b => b.status === 'COMPLETED').length`? Decide before `M13-S27`.
- [x] **After-cancel destination (UC-007):** resolved — redirect to `/{slug}/minha-conta` list after successful cancel; booking appears in Histórico as CANCELLED on next load. Implemented in `M13-S28`.
- [ ] **`infoResponseMessage` already filled:** if the customer already responded to an info request once (status returned to PENDING, then re-requested), should `InfoSubmitForm` show again or just display the previous response? Recommendation carried into `M13-S28`: hide the form when `infoResponseMessage != null`.
- [x] **`GET /v1/bookings` pagination for MVP:** resolved — load all bookings with `limit=50`, display all, no infinite scroll. Implemented in `M13-S27`.
- [ ] **Loyalty conversion-rate UI scope (verify against UC-016):** `M13-S29`'s "10 pts = R$ 1,00" conversion row was carried over from the prototype with only an inline-comment caveat in the original draft. CLAUDE.md describes the loyalty MVP as points-balance only — confirm with product whether the conversion display is actually in scope before shipping `M13-S29`'s conversion row, even though it's gated behind `conversionRate > 0`.

### Manager workspace (Phase 8, M13-S31–M13-S37)

- [ ] **Extra tenant-settings fields** (`auto_approve_enabled`, `max_booking_advance_days`, `min_booking_advance_hours`, `slot_granularity_minutes`, `localization` currency/language, `notification.from_email`, `business_info.social_links`): the backend already supports these, but neither UC-026 nor the Configurações prototype mention them. Needs an explicit scope decision before a story is written for them — don't add silently to `M13-S31`.
- [ ] **Per-module config panels for `SERVICE_LIST`, `GALLERY`, `BOOKING_CTA`, `TESTIMONIALS`, `ABOUT`, `CONTACT`:** only HERO was prototyped as a representative example (`M13-S36`). Each of the other 6 needs its own UX pass — `GALLERY` in particular already has a `feature-booking-photo` BFF endpoint wired that none of the stories above use yet.
- [ ] **BFF-token-based hotsite preview (pixel-exact production-path render):** `M13-S37` ships a pragmatic client-side render instead. Revisit only if the simplified preview proves insufficient in practice.
- [x] **Sidebar "Fidelidade" and "Hotsite" nav items:** both confirmed included from the start in `M13-S15` (the original M125 draft's sidebar spec omitted Hotsite — caught during the manager-workspace cross-file audit and folded into `M13-S15` directly rather than a separate patch).
- [ ] **Per-module "Configurar" UX:** modal, slide-over, or full route? Pick whichever precedent Phase 4/5 already established (`M13-S36` discovery).
- [ ] **`GET /staff` exposing `googleOAuthId`/`deactivatedBy`:** confirm at `M13-S32` discovery; add whichever is missing.
- [x] **Coordinating `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/team`, `/dashboard/hotsite` middleware additions:** resolved by sequencing — `M13-S32` is the first manager-only route story and owns the middleware extension; `M13-S31`/`M13-S35` land after and reuse it rather than each editing `middleware.ts` independently (see `M13-S32`'s AC note).

### Staff loyalty (Phase 1 + Phase 6, M13-S11/M13-S12/M13-S25/M13-S26)

- [x] **`loyaltyConversionRate` in booking detail response:** resolved — added to `StaffBookingDetailResponse` (`M13-S04`'s note), sourced from `M13-S12`, so `M13-S26`'s `MarkCompleteSheet` doesn't need a second BFF call on mount.
- [ ] **"Clientes recentes" query:** does `GET /v1/customers?search=&limit=5` with empty `search` return the 5 most recently active customers (sorted by last booking `completedAt`)? Confirm the backend query plan at `M13-S25`, or simplify to alphabetical sort for MVP.
- [ ] **Redemption notes field in UI:** `RecordRedemptionUseCase` accepts optional `notes`; the prototype auto-fills "Desconto na conclusão do agendamento" (already implemented this way in `M13-S11`). MVP recommendation: auto-fill only, no extra staff-facing input — revisit only if requested.
- [x] **`conversionRate` in the customer-facing balance route too:** resolved — `M13-S12` enriches both the staff (`getBalanceAdmin`) and customer (`getBalance`) routes, so `M13-S29` (customer Fidelidade page) can use the field once it ships.

### Guest submit-info (Phase 9, M13-S38–M13-S40)

- [ ] **`jsonwebtoken` vs. `jose`:** does `jsonwebtoken` work server-side in Next.js 16 (Node.js runtime only, not Edge)? Or should `jose` (Web Crypto API, Edge-compatible) be used for `verifyGuestToken()`? Resolve before `M13-S40`.
- [ ] **Presigned-URL BFF endpoint for unauthenticated guests:** does it exist? Determines whether photo upload is in scope for `M13-S40` (MVP default: text-only, omit upload zone if missing).
- [ ] **Tenant branding on the submit-info page:** the guest token contains `tenantId` but not `tenantSlug`; adding `tenantSlug` to the JWT payload would let the page call `GET /[slug]` for branding. Cosmetic, affects guest trust — not scoped in `M13-S40`, tracked as a post-MVP enhancement.
- [x] **What happens if the guest opens the link after the booking was already approved/rejected/cancelled:** resolved — the API returns `409`/non-`INFO_REQUESTED`, and `M13-S40`'s invalid-link view gets a `reason="processed"` variant with copy "este agendamento já foi processado."

### Non-goals confirmed out of scope for this milestone

- Photo upload on the guest submit-info form, unless the presigned-URL guest endpoint is confirmed to exist (`M13-S39`/`M13-S40`)
- Email template changes — only the link URL changes (`M13-S38`), not the email body
- A BFF preview-token for pixel-exact hotsite preview (`M13-S37` ships the simpler client-side version)
- Per-module config panels for the 6 non-HERO hotsite modules (`M13-S36`)
- Staff explicit logout button, "Bem-vindo" first-login banner, real-time queue updates (all noted above as deferred, not silently dropped)
