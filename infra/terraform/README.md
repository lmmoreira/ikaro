# Ikaro — Terraform Infrastructure

All GCP + Cloudflare infrastructure for Ikaro, as code. Canonical plan: `plan/M17-CLOUD-DEPLOY.md` (§0 decisions, §2 security model — both win over any other doc on conflict).

**Rules (M17 Wave 2 preamble):**
- Modules are generic and env-agnostic; envs compose them. Env-specific values enter only through each env's `terraform.tfvars`.
- Each env is a separate root module with its own GCS state prefix. **No `terraform workspace` usage — ever.**
- Shared variable contract on every module and env: `project_id`, `environment` (validated `staging|prod`), `region` (default `southamerica-east1`), `labels`.
- Version constraints follow HashiCorp's module convention: **modules declare minimums only** (`>= 7.0` google, `>= 5.0` cloudflare in `modules/edge`, `required_version >= 1.15`); **the env roots own the real pins** (`~> 7.0`, `~> 1.15`) backed by their committed `.terraform.lock.hcl` files. Dependabot's `terraform` ecosystem watches both env roots and PRs pin updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`).

## Module dependency graph

```
network ──► database ─────────────┐
storage ──────────────────────────┤
secrets ──► iam ──────────────────┼──► cloudrun-service ──► pubsub ──► scheduler
registry (prod only) ─────────────┘          │
                                             ├──► migrate-job (+ database)
                                             ├──► edge (prod only)
                                             └──► monitoring
```

Instantiation order for a fresh env follows the arrows left to right. `registry` and `edge` exist only in `envs/prod` (D8: single registry serving both envs; D5: staging has no LB).

## Bootstrap prerequisites (M17-S08 — already done, manual, never Terraform)

Terraform assumes these exist (recorded in the operator-local `docs/BOOTSTRAP_LOG.md`, gitignored):

- Projects `ikaro-staging` / `ikaro-prod` with billing, budgets, and the required APIs enabled.
- State bucket **`gs://ikaro-tfstate`** (in `ikaro-prod`, `southamerica-east1`, versioned, uniform access, public access prevention). Env isolation is IAM-conditional on the object prefixes `envs/staging/*` / `envs/prod/*`.
- CI service accounts (`ikaro-tf-deployer@`, `ikaro-app-deployer@`, `ikaro-tf-planner@` × both projects) with Workload Identity Federation — **no SA keys exist anywhere; org policy blocks creating them.**

## Running locally (pre-pipeline only)

Until M17-S24 ships the infra pipeline, plans/applies run from the developer machine:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login   # ADC as admin@ikaro.online — once per machine

cd infra/terraform/envs/staging         # or envs/prod
terraform init
terraform fmt -check -recursive ../..   # both must be clean before any PR
terraform validate
terraform plan                          # review before every apply
terraform apply
```

> ⚠️ **After M17-S24 goes live, ONLY the pipeline applies — never apply prod manually again.** Staging applies happen on merge to `main`; prod applies sit behind the `production-infrastructure` GitHub environment approval. A manual apply after that point bypasses review, drifts state mid-pipeline, and (for prod) sidesteps the WIF environment gate. If an emergency ever seems to require one, fix the pipeline instead — root cause, not workaround.

## State layout

| Env | Backend | State prefix | Project |
|---|---|---|---|
| staging | `gcs` / `ikaro-tfstate` | `envs/staging` | `ikaro-staging` |
| prod | `gcs` / `ikaro-tfstate` | `envs/prod` | `ikaro-prod` |

One state per env, never shared, no workspaces. Secret **values** never appear in state, tfvars, or git — Terraform creates secret *containers* only (M17 §2); values are populated out-of-band by the S27/S37 activation runbooks.

## IAM binding review discipline (read before adding any `google_*_iam_*` resource)

Every `google_*_iam_member` / `google_*_iam_binding` / `google_*_iam_policy` resource in this repo must specify an explicit, deliberately-reviewed `member`/`members` value. Never add `allUsers`, `allAuthenticatedUsers`, or a principal outside `ikaro.online`'s own domain without that being the specific, intentional point of the resource (e.g. `modules/storage`'s public hotsite bucket) — and call it out in review. **Do not assume an org-level policy will catch a mistake here** — current org-policy state (and the reasoning behind any project-level exception) lives in the gitignored, operator-local `docs/BOOTSTRAP_LOG.md`, not in this repo's public history.

**Enforced automatically, not just by review discipline:** a custom Checkov check (`CKV_IKARO_1`, `.checkov/custom_checks/no_public_iam_grant.py`) hard-fails CI on any `allUsers`/`allAuthenticatedUsers` grant across every IAM resource type used in this repo, unless explicitly suppressed with a documented `#checkov:skip=CKV_IKARO_1:<reason>` — same discipline as every other Checkov skip here. Static analysis only: it has no visibility into anything created outside this repo's `.tf` files. Reproduce CI's scan locally with:

```bash
cd infra/terraform
checkov -d . --framework terraform --external-checks-dir .checkov/custom_checks
```

## Unit-test convention (M17 Wave 2 preamble)

Any module containing **logic** — variable `validation` blocks, `precondition`/`check` blocks, non-trivial locals (lookup maps, derived values) — ships native `terraform test` cases in `tests/*.tftest.hcl`, following HashiCorp module conventions:

- **`command = plan` + `mock_provider` only** — tests run with no credentials, create no resources, and cost nothing.
- Name files `*_unit_test.tftest.hcl` (plan mode); there are no apply-mode tests in this repo.
- Thin declarative modules (plain resource wrappers with no logic) are exempt — a test that restates the config adds nothing.
- Copy the working example: `modules/network/tests/variables_unit_test.tftest.hcl` (valid-input assert + `expect_failures` on an invalid input).
- **Happy path + unhappy path, not just shape assertions (M17-S14 discovery, 2026-07-17):** every variable that carries a `validation` block needs both a valid-input case (plans clean) *and* an `expect_failures` case proving the invalid input is actually rejected — a validation block nobody's test exercises can silently rot. A resource-level `precondition`/`check` needs the same pair. Don't stop at "the happy-path plan looks right" — a config that *should* fail to plan and doesn't is exactly the kind of gap that surfaces as a live incident instead of a red test (see `modules/storage/tests/variables_unit_test.tftest.hcl`'s `rejects_empty_cors_origins` for the pattern: an empty CORS origin list would otherwise silently plan a bucket that blocks every browser upload).

```bash
cd infra/terraform/modules/network
terraform init      # downloads the provider; still no credentials needed
terraform test
```

Tests run in CI from M17-S24's PR job; Checkov scans `infra/terraform/**` on every PR (`.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`).

## Gotchas (cross-cutting — read before touching Checkov config or app-consumed env vars)

- **`checkov --external-checks-dir` silently no-ops without an `__init__.py` in that directory.** No error, no warning at default log level — the scan just runs as if the directory didn't exist (same pass/fail counts as without it). Checkov's loader walks the directory tree and skips (INFO-level log only) any directory lacking `__init__.py` before importing anything inside it. `.checkov/custom_checks/` in this repo carries an (intentionally empty) `__init__.py` for exactly this reason — don't remove it, and add one to any new custom-checks directory.
- **The `bridgecrewio/checkov-action` GitHub Action's input is `external_checks_dirs` (plural)**, while the Checkov CLI flag it wraps is `--external-checks-dir` (singular). They are not the same string — copying one into the other silently does nothing (the Action ignores an unrecognized input key rather than failing). Verify against the action's own `action.yml` at the pinned SHA before trusting either name from memory.
- **Before writing a Terraform-side value for an app-consumed env var, trace how the app's own code actually composes it — don't infer the format from a story/plan doc's prose alone.** `GCS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` was specified in `plan/M17-CLOUD-DEPLOY.md` as already including the bucket name (`https://storage.googleapis.com/ikaro-public-{env}`), but `GcsSignedUrlAdapter.getPublicUrl()` appends `GCS_PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME` itself — the documented value would have doubled the bucket segment and broken every hotsite image URL. Caught only by reading the adapter source during M17-S14 discovery, not from the plan text. The general rule: any env var one module's Terraform sets and another codebase's adapter reads deserves a quick grep of the actual consuming code before the value is finalized.
- **`google_cloud_run_v2_service` has two similarly-shaped `scaling` blocks — putting a cap on the wrong one silently changes its meaning.** The top-level `scaling { max_instance_count }` is "combined maximum... for all revisions receiving traffic"; `template { scaling { max_instance_count } }` is "Scaling settings for this Revision" — per-revision. M17-S18 shipped with the connection-math-critical backend cap on `template.scaling` for a full review cycle: during a rolling deploy the old and new revisions both serve traffic, so each could independently reach the per-revision cap, silently doubling the real ceiling (and doubling the backend's DB connection count against the tier's limit). Neither Checkov, Snyk, nor Trivy catch this — it's a Cloud Run semantics issue, not a security/dependency one. Caught only by manual review. When a resource has two nested blocks with the same name and near-identical attributes, dump the provider's own JSON schema (`terraform providers schema -json`, or `jq` into it) and read each block's `description` — don't assume from either block's name or from prior experience with a different resource.
- **`check` blocks do not fail `terraform plan`/`apply` — they only warn.** Verified empirically (M17-S18): a `check { assert { condition = false ... } }` prints a `Warning: Check block assertion failed` and the command still exits `0`. If an invariant needs to actually block a bad apply (the same rigor as `tests/connection_math.tftest.hcl`'s cross-variable `validation`), use a `variable { validation {} }` (only when every referenced object is a variable/local in the same module — see next bullet) or a `lifecycle { precondition {} }` on a real resource. Reach for `check` only when a visible-but-non-blocking warning is the actual intent.
- **A `variable { validation {} }` condition CAN reference a `local` — but only if the condition also references the variable being validated itself somewhere in the same expression.** A condition that references *only* a local (no `var.<self>` anywhere) is rejected outright: `"The condition for variable \"x\" must refer to var.x in order to test incoming values."` A first attempt without the self-reference makes it look like locals are banned from variable validations entirely — they aren't. See `modules/cloudrun-service/variables.tf`'s `max_instance_count` validation (references `local.tier_max_connections` *and* `var.max_instance_count` together) for a working example.
- **Direct VPC egress has real, documented capacity and timing constraints — worth checking before sizing anything.** Per Google's own docs: Cloud Run consumes **~2 IP addresses per instance** on the subnet; Google's stated minimum subnet size is **`/26` or larger**; and a new instance's Direct VPC connection can take **"a minute or more"** to establish on cold startup. A too-strict startup probe budget (e.g. 3 retries × 10s = 30s) can kill an otherwise-healthy revision before it ever gets a chance to serve traffic — size the probe budget well past a minute, and size `max_instance_count` against the shared subnet's actual usable-IP count (accounting for every Direct-VPC service sharing that subnet, not just one).
- **A Cloud Run v2 service's default `*.run.app` URL is NOT deterministic — it's a per-project random hash** (e.g. `ikaro-bff-crle4i3nrq-rj.a.run.app`), confirmed via a real staging apply (M17-S18, 2026-07-19). An earlier version of this bullet claimed `<service-name>-<project-number>.<region>.run.app` was the format; that assumption is wrong. Terraform also cannot reference a resource's own computed output (e.g. `google_cloud_run_v2_service.this.uri`) from within that same resource's own configuration block, regardless of whether the URL were deterministic — for the handful of env vars a service needs pointing at *itself*, pick based on what the value actually needs to be:
  - If it must literally be the real URL (e.g. `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`), there's no way around a two-apply bootstrap: apply once with a placeholder default, read the real value from the service's own `service_uri` output, paste it into the env's `terraform.tfvars` (e.g. `bff_real_uri` in `envs/staging/variables.tf`), apply again.
  - If it only needs to be *some* stable, self-consistent string both sides agree on (e.g. a Pub/Sub push OIDC audience), skip the URL problem entirely — mint a fixed, self-chosen string via `custom_audiences` instead (see `envs/staging/main.tf`'s `local.backend_pubsub_audience`, consumed by M17-S19's push subscriptions). No bootstrap dance needed.
- **A Secret Manager secret with zero versions fails the Cloud Run *deploy* that mounts it, not just leaves the env var empty.** Cloud Run resolves `value_source.secret_key_ref` at revision-creation time (a control-plane operation), not lazily inside the running container — so a service provisioned ahead of its secrets' real values being populated (e.g. M17-S18's placeholder-image bootstrap phase, before the S27 activation runbook runs) must gate secret-mounting behind the same flag that gates using the real image. Don't assume an empty/unpopulated secret container is harmless to reference.
