# TD24 — Transactional Outbox + Inbox Pattern (shared schema)

## Status
- **Type**: Architecture / Reliability
- **Priority**: High (closes TD08 AUD-001 🔴 Critical — the single highest-leverage item in the audit backlog; also unblocks AUD-003, AUD-004, AUD-018)
- **Contexts affected**: `shared` (new infrastructure), every context that publishes domain events (`booking`, `loyalty`, `staff`, `platform`) and every context that consumes them (`notification`, `loyalty`, `staff`)
- **Discovered**: 2026-07-10 (M17-S03 PR #107 review — a `cron_run_log` idempotency table was built, found to be a false guarantee, and removed)
- **Design resolved**: 2026-07-10 (discovery discussion; full code sweep verified the inventory, the DI wiring, and the test-infrastructure impact — see §Investigation)

## Problem

Every domain-event publish in the backend is a **dual write**: business state commits in a Postgres transaction, then `eventBus.publish()` calls Pub/Sub *after* the commit. A crash or Pub/Sub failure between the two loses the event forever — the business state says "it happened," no notification/reaction ever fires, and nothing records that an event should have existed.

```ts
// the shape at every one of the 21 publish sites today:
await this.txManager.run(async () => {
  await this.bookingRepo.save(booking);
});
// ← crash here = event lost forever
for (const event of booking.clearDomainEvents()) {
  await this.eventBus.publish(event); // ← failure here = event lost forever
}
```

The inverse problem exists for cron jobs: a retried/overlapping trigger invocation publishes the **same business fact twice as two distinct messages with two fresh `eventId`s** (`DomainEvent`'s constructor calls `uuidv7()` unconditionally), so consumer-side `eventId` dedup never sees a duplicate — the customer gets two emails.

M17-S03's `cron_run_log` attempt failed because `markRun()` can never be atomic with a Pub/Sub publish — the exact dual-write this TD eliminates. See `plan/M17-CLOUD-DEPLOY.md` S03 discovery note (2026-07-10) for the full post-mortem.

## Investigation — verified inventory (2026-07-10 code sweep)

### A. Publish sites — 21 `eventBus.publish()` calls across 20 files (`booking-reminder.job.ts` has 2)

**A1. Aggregate-driven (16 use cases, each with a `clearDomainEvents()` loop after `txManager.run()`):**

| Context | Use case files (`contexts/<ctx>/application/use-cases/`) |
|---|---|
| booking (11) | `approve-booking`, `reject-booking`, `cancel-booking-as-admin`, `cancel-booking-as-customer`, `complete-booking`, `reschedule-booking`, `request-booking`, `request-authenticated-booking`, `submit-booking-info`, `submit-guest-booking-info`, `request-more-info` |
| staff (4) | `invite-staff`, `activate-staff`, `deactivate-staff`, `create-initial-manager` |
| platform (1) | `provision-tenant` |

**A2. Directly-constructed events (5 sites, no aggregate involved):**

| File | Event(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `booking/application/jobs/booking-reminder.job.ts` | `BookingReminderDue` (L70), `BookingReminderDueToday` (L88) | cron-triggered, at-least-once |
| `booking/application/jobs/admin-schedule-reminder.job.ts` | `AdminDailyScheduleReminder` (L52) | cron-triggered |
| `loyalty/application/jobs/notify-expiring-points.job.ts` | `PointsExpiringSoon` (L51) | cron-triggered |
| `loyalty/application/use-cases/complete-booking-loyalty-effects/complete-booking-loyalty-effects.use-case.ts` | `ServicePointsEarned` (L145) | **consumer re-emit, published AFTER the `markProcessed` tx** — a publish failure loses it *permanently* (the `BookingCompleted` redelivery is skipped by the idempotency check). TD08 §12.3, the worst single site. |

**A3. Aggregates that emit events — only 3** (verified: `addDomainEvent` appears only in these): `booking/domain/booking.aggregate.ts`, `platform/domain/tenant.aggregate.ts`, `staff/domain/staff.aggregate.ts`. Loyalty aggregates emit nothing — every loyalty event is directly constructed (A2). So the repository auto-flush (D6) touches exactly **3 repositories**: `typeorm-booking.repository.ts`, `typeorm-tenant.repository.ts` (the raw TypeORM adapter, NOT `caching-tenant.repository.ts` — cache concerns stay out of it per CLAUDE.md §7), `typeorm-staff.repository.ts`.

**A4. NOT in scope as publish sites** (verified, do not touch): `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter.publishToDlq()` (consumer-side DLQ routing, internal to the adapter); `publishTrigger()` calls in `cron-booking.controller.ts` / `cron-loyalty.controller.ts` (cron ticks are not domain events — trigger channel bypasses the outbox by design); the BFF (publishes nothing — verified by grep).

### B. Consumers — what exists, what changes, what doesn't

**B1. Event handlers (subscribe via `EVENT_BUS`) — handlers themselves are UNCHANGED by this TD** (they call exactly one use case and rethrow; the idempotency lives in the use cases):

| Context | Handlers |
|---|---|
| notification (14) | `booking-approved`, `booking-cancelled`, `booking-info-requested`, `booking-info-submitted`, `booking-rejected`, `booking-requested`, `booking-rescheduled`, `booking-reminder`, `admin-daily-schedule-reminder`, `points-expiring-soon`, `service-points-earned`, `staff-invited`, `tenant-provisioned`, `dead-letter` |
| loyalty (1) | `booking-completed` |
| staff (1) | `tenant-provisioned` |

`dead-letter.handler.ts` is log-only (never throws, no side effects) — needs no inbox, ignore it in S04.

**B2. Trigger handlers (cron, not domain events — unchanged):** booking: `booking-reminder-trigger`, `admin-schedule-reminder-trigger`; loyalty: `expire-points-trigger`, `notify-expiring-points-trigger`. (`ExpirePointsJob` publishes nothing — DB-only, naturally idempotent.)

**B3. Idempotency today (the "inbox-lite"):**

| Consumer | Mechanism | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| loyalty ← `BookingCompleted` | `loyalty.processed_events` `(event_id, consumer_name)` PK; `markProcessed` **inside the same tx** as the business write (`complete-booking-loyalty-effects`) | Correct pattern — this is what `shared.inbox` generalizes |
| notification ← 13 event handlers | `notification.processed_events` `(event_id, notification_type, channel)` PK; `BaseNotificationUseCase.isAlreadySent()` before dispatch; `markProcessed` in same tx as the `notification_logs` save | Correct, finer-grained key |
| staff ← `TenantProvisioned` | **none** — `create-initial-manager` has no dedup | Gap — covered in S04 |

`notification.notification_logs` is **not** a dedup table — it is the `NotificationLog` domain aggregate (§3 bounded contexts): audit record with sent/failed status, recipient, `tenant_id`. Kept (D7).

### C. Wiring & infrastructure facts the design depends on (verified)

1. **Ambient transaction context** — `shared/infrastructure/transaction-context.ts` (AsyncLocalStorage): `getActiveEntityManager()` exposes the live transactional `EntityManager` anywhere under `txManager.run()`; `scheduleAfterCommit(cb)` runs `cb` after commit — **or immediately when no transaction is ambient** (verified: falls through to `callback()` directly). The outbox adapter relies on both behaviors. Two more verified behaviors the design MUST respect:
   - **After-commit callbacks are awaited *inside* `txManager.run()`** (`typeorm-transaction-manager.ts` flushes them before `run()` returns) — so after-commit work runs *before* the HTTP response is sent, not in the background.
   - **`flushAfterCommitCallbacks` has no try/catch** — a callback that throws propagates out of `txManager.run()` *after the commit already happened* AND aborts the remaining callbacks (they were already `splice(0)`'d off, so they are lost, not retried). Consequence: any callback the outbox schedules must swallow its own errors internally — see §Design's inline-dispatch rule.
2. **DI wiring** (`shared/infrastructure/event-bus.module.ts`): `EVENT_BUS → useClass: GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter`; **`TRIGGER_BUS` and `PUSHABLE_EVENT_BUS` are `useExisting: EVENT_BUS` aliases** — they resolve to whatever `EVENT_BUS` resolves to, including test overrides. ⚠️ Consequence: rebinding `EVENT_BUS` to the outbox bus drags both aliases with it — the outbox bus **must implement `IEventBus`, `ITriggerBus`, and `IPushableEventBus`, delegating everything except `publish()`** to the inner Pub/Sub adapter (see §Design). Do not restructure the aliases.
3. **Trigger channel** (M17-S03/D3): `ITriggerBus.registerTrigger()` + Cloud Scheduler → Pub/Sub → `/pubsub/push`, with thin `/cron/*` controllers for local/manual runs — the relay sweep copies this exact pattern.
4. **Test doubles** (`src/test/infrastructure/`): `in-memory-event-bus.ts` (unit) and `routing-in-memory-event-bus.ts` (integration — **synchronously dispatches to subscribed handlers inside `publish()`**, BFS for nested publishes). ⚠️ Consequence: once repos drain events *inside* the transaction, a synchronous dispatch would run handlers mid-transaction (separate connections → they cannot see the uncommitted business write; deadlock risk). The routing bus must defer dispatch via `scheduleAfterCommit()` — see S02.
5. **Schema bootstrap** — `1700000000000-BootstrapSchemas.ts` creates the 6 context schemas + `ikaro_app` grants. `shared` is added via a **new** migration (never edit an applied one), same grant block.
6. Integration tests run against real Postgres; **new entities/migrations must be registered in `integration-global-setup.ts` and `test-datasource.ts` in the same commit** (§7 testing rule — silent failure otherwise).

## Decisions (resolved 2026-07-10)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Relay = inline best-effort dispatch after commit + scheduled sweep as the guarantee.** Two *triggers*, one *publication path* — both call the same relay function. | Near-instant happy-path latency for customer-facing events; correctness owned by the sweep. The only always-on-free alternatives (CDC/log-tailing, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`) need an always-on component — ruled out. |
| D2 | **No CDC / Debezium — explicitly rejected.** | Heaviest infra in the stack for a load level the app doesn't have; always-on container breaks D1/D2 scale-to-zero and D12 budget; replication-slot WAL pinning is an outage risk on `db-f1-micro`. |
| D3 | **Sweep every 5 minutes, parameterized** (Terraform `var.outbox_relay_schedule`, default `*/5 * * * *`). Batch size, grace window, and inline-dispatch on/off are env vars. | Fixed-rate cost (~8,640 ticks/month ≈ $0 under free tiers — cost is *bounded by design*, independent of traffic). The interval only caps worst-case delivery delay after a failure; happy-path latency comes from the inline dispatch. |
| D4 | **Scope = all 21 publish sites**, phased across stories. | Two publishing paths with different reliability guarantees is worse than one unreliable path. The DI rebind makes cutover mostly mechanical. |
| D5 | **`dedup_key` column with `UNIQUE` + `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.** Aggregate events use their `eventId`; cron jobs supply deterministic business keys. | The atomic, row-granular fix for the cron double-run that `cron_run_log` couldn't be: a mid-loop crash retries only un-inserted rows (no silently-dropped remainder), and two overlapping runs collapse to one row per business fact. |
| D6 | **Aggregate events reach the outbox automatically on repository `save()`** — the 3 event-emitting aggregates' repositories drain `clearDomainEvents()` through the injected `EVENT_BUS` inside `save()`. Use cases lose their publish loops entirely. | Not the use case's job; the ORM repository *is* the DDD repository, so persisting the aggregate and its pending events is one concern. Draining **via the `EVENT_BUS` port** (not by writing outbox rows directly) keeps test overrides working and keeps repos decoupled from outbox internals. Removes the "developer forgot to publish" failure class. |
| D7 | **`shared.inbox` `(event_id, consumer_name)` replaces both `processed_events` tables.** notification's granularity preserved via consumer-name composition (`<TRIGGER_EVENT>:<CHANNEL>`). `notification_logs` **stays** (domain aggregate, audit/BI). staff gains the coverage it lacks. | One physical table instead of per-context copies (the duplication that tripped SonarCloud in M17-S03); pre-production, so migration is a simple copy + drop. |
| D8 | **Retention, both tables, enforced by the sweep tick — no separate cleanup job.** Both default to **14 days**, parameterized (`OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS`, `INBOX_RETENTION_DAYS`). Inbox retention must stay above Pub/Sub's 7-day max redelivery window or the dedup guarantee weakens — enforce with a startup config check (`INBOX_RETENTION_DAYS >= 8`). Deletes are batched (`DELETE WHERE id IN (SELECT … LIMIT :batchSize)`). | Debug/replay window without unbounded growth. Because the GC runs every tick, it's a continuous trickle (a few rows per tick), never a mass delete — autovacuum absorbs it. |
| D10 | **No table partitioning.** | Postgres requires UNIQUE/PK constraints on partitioned tables to include the partition key — partitioning by time would outlaw `UNIQUE(dedup_key)` and `PK(event_id, consumer_name)`, breaking the constraint-backed idempotency (`ON CONFLICT` stops working; dedup degrades to racy SELECT-then-INSERT). At current volumes the trickle-delete costs nothing; if volume ever makes retention genuinely expensive, revisit partitioning *together with* a side-table global-uniqueness design as its own TD. |
| D9 | **Ordering: out of scope.** Relay uses `SKIP LOCKED` (out-of-order-safe); no Pub/Sub ordering keys. | Matches current behavior (no ordering today). Ordering keys per booking remain TD08 AUD-018, a separate follow-up. |

## Design

### `shared.outbox`

```sql
-- new migration adds the schema (same grant block as BootstrapSchemas):
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "shared";

CREATE TABLE "shared"."outbox" (
  "id"           UUID         NOT NULL,            -- = eventId from the envelope
  "dedup_key"    VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,            -- eventId for aggregate events; deterministic business key for cron events
  "tenant_id"    UUID         NOT NULL,            -- for observability/filtering (transport table — see tenant-isolation note, S04)
  "event_name"   VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,            -- relay derives topic: ikaro-<event_name>
  "payload"      JSONB        NOT NULL,            -- the full DomainEvent envelope, verbatim
  "created_at"   TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  "published_at" TIMESTAMPTZ  NULL,                -- NULL = not yet relayed
  CONSTRAINT "PK_shared_outbox" PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
  CONSTRAINT "UQ_shared_outbox_dedup_key" UNIQUE ("dedup_key")
);

-- partial index: the sweep's working set is only unpublished rows
CREATE INDEX "IDX_shared_outbox_unpublished"
  ON "shared"."outbox" ("created_at") WHERE "published_at" IS NULL;

-- partial index: the GC's working set is only published rows (D8)
CREATE INDEX "IDX_shared_outbox_published_gc"
  ON "shared"."outbox" ("published_at") WHERE "published_at" IS NOT NULL;
```

Insert is always `INSERT … ON CONFLICT ("dedup_key") DO NOTHING RETURNING "id"` — a second attempt to record the same business fact is a silent no-op *inside the same atomic transaction as the caller's business write*. Only ids actually returned (i.e., actually inserted) are scheduled for inline dispatch — a conflicting insert schedules nothing (the first writer owns delivery).

### `OutboxEventBus` (the automatic seam)

New `shared/infrastructure/outbox-event-bus.ts`, bound as `EVENT_BUS`. Because `TRIGGER_BUS`/`PUSHABLE_EVENT_BUS` alias `EVENT_BUS` (§C2), it implements **all three ports**:

- `publish(event)` → **intercepted**: writes the outbox row using `getActiveEntityManager()` if a transaction is ambient (**joins the caller's transaction** — this is the atomicity), or its own short transaction if not. Dedup key = `event.dedupKey ?? event.eventId`. On successful insert, registers the row id via `scheduleAfterCommit()` for inline dispatch (which, per §C1, runs immediately when no tx is ambient — so non-transactional publishes still get instant delivery).
- `subscribe()`, `registerTrigger()`, `publishTrigger()`, `dispatchPushMessage()` → **pure delegation** to the inner `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter` (registered as its own class provider; stays the singleton that owns Pub/Sub connections, push dispatch, and DLQ routing — its consumer role is untouched).
- **Inline dispatch is awaited inside the after-commit callback** — it runs after the commit and before the HTTP response returns (adds ~10–100 ms to event-emitting endpoints; accepted). This is deliberate, not an accident of §C1: a fire-and-forget floating promise would race Cloud Run's request-based CPU allocation — CPU is throttled once the response is sent, so a background publish gets starved, fails silently, and every "happy path" quietly degrades to sweep latency (up to 5 min for customer-facing emails). Awaiting before the response is the only Cloud-Run-safe option without paying for always-allocated CPU.
- Inline dispatch **never throws into the caller**: the try/catch lives **inside the callback passed to `scheduleAfterCommit`** — this placement is mandatory, not stylistic. Per §C1, `flushAfterCommitCallbacks` has no try/catch: an escaping error would propagate out of `txManager.run()` *after* the commit (the use case would report failure for work that committed) and abort the remaining callbacks (other events' inline dispatch silently lost). Dispatch errors are logged and left to the sweep; the use case succeeded the moment the transaction committed.

`DomainEvent` gains an optional readonly `dedupKey?: string` (default `undefined` → adapter falls back to `eventId`). Only the cron-job events set it. It serializes into `payload` like any other field; consumers ignore it.

### Repository auto-flush (D6)

The 3 event-emitting aggregates' TypeORM repositories inject `EVENT_BUS` and, as the last step of `save()` (inside the ambient transaction):

```ts
for (const event of aggregate.clearDomainEvents()) {
  await this.eventBus.publish(event); // = outbox row in the SAME transaction
}
```

(Extract as a tiny shared helper, e.g. `shared/infrastructure/drain-domain-events.ts`, to avoid three copies — SonarCloud duplication gate.)

- Exactly 3 repos now (§A3); the pattern becomes part of the "new aggregate" recipe in `docs/ENGINEERING_RULES.md`.
- For `Tenant`: the drain goes in `typeorm-tenant.repository.ts` (persistence adapter), **not** `caching-tenant.repository.ts` — the cache decorator keeps delegating `save()` and owning only cache invalidation.
- Events constructed outside aggregates (§A2) keep calling `eventBus.publish()` explicitly — which is now an outbox write.
- **Invariant change (doc sweep):** CLAUDE.md §7 currently says "flush `clearDomainEvents()` **after** `txManager.run()`". New invariant: *aggregate events are drained to the outbox by the repository inside the save transaction; use cases never flush aggregate events; direct `eventBus.publish()` is only for non-aggregate events (jobs, re-emits) and must run inside `txManager.run()` when it must be atomic with a business write.*

### Relay — one publication path, two triggers

`shared/infrastructure/outbox-relay.service.ts` — a single `relay(rowIds?)` used by both:

1. **Inline dispatch** (happy path): after commit, called with the exact row ids that transaction inserted. Publishes each via the inner `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter.publish()` (payload is the verbatim envelope; topic = `ikaro-<event_name>`), then `UPDATE … SET published_at = now() WHERE id = :id AND published_at IS NULL`. Errors are swallowed + logged — the sweep is the retry.
2. **Scheduled sweep** (the guarantee): Cloud Scheduler → Pub/Sub trigger `cron-outbox-relay` (registered on `ITriggerBUS` like the M17-S03 cron triggers; thin `/cron/outbox-relay` controller mirrors `cron-booking.controller.ts` for local/manual runs):

```sql
SELECT * FROM shared.outbox
WHERE published_at IS NULL
  AND created_at < now() - make_interval(secs => :graceSeconds)  -- don't race the inline path
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT :batchSize
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

   publish → mark published, loop until an empty batch. `SKIP LOCKED` makes overlapping sweeps and sweep-vs-inline races safe.

   The same tick runs the retention GC (D8/D10 — batched trickle-deletes, no partitioning):

```sql
DELETE FROM shared.outbox
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM shared.outbox
  WHERE published_at < now() - make_interval(days => :outboxRetentionDays)  -- default 14
  LIMIT :batchSize
);
-- and, once S04 lands:
DELETE FROM shared.inbox
WHERE (event_id, consumer_name) IN (
  SELECT event_id, consumer_name FROM shared.inbox
  WHERE processed_at < now() - make_interval(days => :inboxRetentionDays)   -- default 14, min 8 (D8)
  LIMIT :batchSize
);
```

**Config:** `OUTBOX_INLINE_DISPATCH_ENABLED` (default `true`), `OUTBOX_SWEEP_BATCH_SIZE` (default `100`), `OUTBOX_SWEEP_GRACE_SECONDS` (default `30`), `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `14`), `INBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `14`, startup check enforces ≥ 8 per D8), Terraform `var.outbox_relay_schedule` (default `*/5 * * * *`).

**Marking rule:** `published_at` is set **only after** a successful Pub/Sub publish. Never before.

### Failure matrix (why this closes the dual write)

| Failure | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Crash/error before commit | Business write and outbox row roll back together — consistent nothing-happened |
| Crash after commit, before inline dispatch | Row is durable with `published_at IS NULL` → next sweep publishes it. **Late, never lost** |
| Inline publish to Pub/Sub fails | Swallowed + logged; row stays unpublished → sweep retries |
| Publish succeeded but response timed out / crash before the `UPDATE` | Row stays unpublished → sweep republishes **the same `eventId`** → consumer inbox drops the duplicate |
| Sweep crashes mid-batch | Unmarked rows retried next tick; marked rows were published. Same-`eventId` duplicates possible, inbox absorbs |
| Cron job invoked twice (overlap/retry) | Second run's inserts hit `ON CONFLICT (dedup_key) DO NOTHING` → one row per business fact → **one email** |
| Cron job crashes mid-loop | Rows inserted so far are durable and will publish; the re-run re-inserts them as no-ops and continues with the rest. No silently-dropped remainder (the flaw that killed `cron_run_log`'s coarse gate) |

End-to-end: **at-least-once delivery, exactly-once effect** (dedup at both edges: `dedup_key` producer-side, `(event_id, consumer_name)` consumer-side).

### Deterministic dedup keys for cron-published events

The three publishing jobs set `dedupKey` to a business identity (exact formats + the timezone-of-day rule finalized in S03 discovery — a job straddling midnight must not mint two keys for one logical run):

| Event | dedup_key shape |
|---|---|
| `PointsExpiringSoon` | `PointsExpiringSoon:<tenantId>:<customerId>:<yyyy-mm-dd>` |
| `BookingReminderDue` / `BookingReminderDueToday` | `<EventName>:<tenantId>:<bookingId>:<yyyy-mm-dd>` |
| `AdminDailyScheduleReminder` | `AdminDailyScheduleReminder:<tenantId>:<yyyy-mm-dd>` |

### `shared.inbox`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "shared"."inbox" (
  "event_id"      UUID         NOT NULL,
  "consumer_name" VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  "processed_at"  TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT "PK_shared_inbox" PRIMARY KEY ("event_id", "consumer_name")
);

-- for the retention GC (D8)
CREATE INDEX "IDX_shared_inbox_processed_at" ON "shared"."inbox" ("processed_at");
```

- Shared port (`shared/ports/inbox.port.ts`): `hasBeenProcessed(eventId, consumerName)` / `markProcessed(eventId, consumerName)` — `markProcessed` must run **inside the consumer's business transaction** (the pattern loyalty already implements).
- Consumer names: loyalty `'COMPLETE_BOOKING_LOYALTY_EFFECTS'` (unchanged value, new table); notification `'<TRIGGER_EVENT>:<CHANNEL>'` (preserves today's `(event_id, notification_type, channel)` granularity in one string); staff `'CREATE_INITIAL_MANAGER'` (new coverage).
- Pre-production migration: `INSERT INTO shared.inbox SELECT …` from both old tables (composing notification's key), then `DROP` both. No dual-write/backfill choreography.

### Cost model (D3)

Fixed-rate by construction — independent of tenant/traffic volume: ~8,640 sweep ticks/month ≈ ~1,700 vCPU-s (free tier 180,000), 8,640 requests (free tier 2M), a few MB Pub/Sub (free tier 10 GiB), one Cloud Scheduler job ($0–0.10/mo). The wake-on-push pattern is the one M17 already accepted for the existing cron triggers and uptime checks.

---

## Stories (chronological — run `/story-discovery TD24-SNN` before each, per §0)

> **Sequencing rationale:** each story leaves `main` shippable. S01 ships dark (nothing writes to the outbox). S02 is the atomic cutover — after it, **every** `publish()` call (use cases AND jobs) already flows through the outbox, because the rebind intercepts all of them; jobs just run with the `eventId` fallback dedup key until S03 refines them. Consumers keep their existing dedup until S04 — it keeps working against relay-published events because `eventId`s are preserved verbatim end-to-end. S03 and S04 are independent of each other; keep this order because S03 closes the two motivating bugs (cron double-send, §12.3 lost re-emit) and S04 is consolidation.

---

### TD24-S01 — Outbox foundation (ships dark)

Nothing is rebound; no behavior changes. Everything is built and tested in isolation.

**Create:**
- Migration `AddSharedSchema` — `CREATE SCHEMA shared` + the `ikaro_app` grant block copied from `BootstrapSchemas` (new migration; never edit the applied one). ⚠️ Migration timestamps are global across contexts — pick the next free timestamp.
- Migration `CreateSharedOutbox` — table + partial index per §Design.
- `shared/infrastructure/entities/outbox-event.entity.ts` (TypeORM entity, `schema: 'shared'`).
- `shared/infrastructure/outbox-event-bus.ts` — implements `IEventBus` + `ITriggerBus` + `IPushableEventBus`; `publish()` = ambient-EM insert with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING id` + `scheduleAfterCommit` hook (dispatch awaited + errors swallowed *inside* the callback, per §Design); everything else delegates to an injected `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter`. ⚠️ TypeORM's `repository.save()` cannot express `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING` — use the query builder (`.insert().orIgnore().returning('id')`) or raw SQL through the ambient `EntityManager`; do not detour through `save()`.
- `shared/infrastructure/outbox-relay.service.ts` — `relay(rowIds?)`, sweep query (grace window, batch loop, `SKIP LOCKED`), retention GC (`OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 14), marking rule.
- Trigger wiring: `cron-outbox-relay` constant + trigger handler (mirror `booking/infrastructure/events/booking-reminder-trigger.handler.ts`) + thin `/cron/outbox-relay` controller (mirror `cron-booking.controller.ts`).
- `DomainEvent.dedupKey?: string` optional readonly field (default undefined; no subclass changes yet).
- Config wiring: `OUTBOX_INLINE_DISPATCH_ENABLED`, `OUTBOX_SWEEP_BATCH_SIZE`, `OUTBOX_SWEEP_GRACE_SECONDS`, `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 14). (`INBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` + its ≥ 8 startup check arrive with the inbox in S04.)
- Test support: outbox entity builder (`src/test/builders/shared/`), in-memory outbox repo double if needed (`src/test/infrastructure/`).

**Modify:**
- `integration-global-setup.ts` + `test-datasource.ts` — register new entity + migrations (**same commit** as the migrations).
- `shared/infrastructure/event-bus.module.ts` — register `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter` as an explicit class provider (so S02's rebind is a one-line change); `EVENT_BUS` still resolves to it.

**Tests (unit + integration):**
- publish inside `txManager.run()` → row rolls back with the business write; publish outside any tx → row committed standalone.
- `dedup_key` conflict → no row, no inline dispatch scheduled.
- **after-commit error isolation:** two publishes in one `txManager.run()`, inner adapter throws on the first inline dispatch → `run()` resolves normally (no error into the caller), the second event still dispatches, the first row stays unpublished for the sweep.
- relay marks `published_at` **only** on successful Pub/Sub publish; failed publish leaves row unpublished.
- **transport round-trip (emulator):** relay publishes the stored envelope through the real `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter` against the Pub/Sub emulator → received message is byte-identical to the pre-outbox envelope (`eventId`/`correlationId`/`occurredAt` survive the JSONB round-trip verbatim — this is what keeps consumer dedup working).
- sweep: respects grace window; `SKIP LOCKED` (two concurrent sweeps → each row published once); loops until empty; GC deletes only published rows older than `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS`.

**Infra note:** the Cloud Scheduler job + topic (`var.outbox_relay_schedule`, default `*/5 * * * *`) lands in the M17 Terraform tree — add to the M17 scheduler module/story, not a parallel mechanism.

**Acceptance:** all new code merged, zero call-site behavior change; `EVENT_BUS` still the raw Pub/Sub adapter.

---

### TD24-S02 — Cutover: rebind + repository auto-flush (all aggregate events)

The atomic story: rebind, drain, delete the 16 loops, fix the test bus — these ship together because each half breaks without the other.

**Modify — DI (1 file):**
- `event-bus.module.ts`: `EVENT_BUS → useClass: OutboxEventBus`. The `TRIGGER_BUS`/`PUSHABLE_EVENT_BUS` aliases stay untouched (they now resolve to `OutboxEventBus`, which delegates those ports — verified design, §C2).

**Modify — repositories (3 files + 1 new helper):**
- `shared/infrastructure/drain-domain-events.ts` helper; call it at the end of `save()` in `booking/infrastructure/repositories/typeorm-booking.repository.ts`, `platform/infrastructure/repositories/typeorm-tenant.repository.ts`, `staff/infrastructure/repositories/typeorm-staff.repository.ts`. (NOT `caching-tenant.repository.ts`.)

**Modify — use cases (16 files, §A1 list):** delete the `clearDomainEvents()` publish loop (and the now-unused `EVENT_BUS` injection where nothing else uses it) from all 11 booking + 4 staff + 1 platform use cases. Each use case's event emission is now implicit in `repo.save()` inside its existing `txManager.run()`.

**Modify — unit-test repository doubles (3 files) — REQUIRED, or ~16 unit suites go red:**
- `src/test/repositories/booking/in-memory-booking.repository.ts`, `src/test/repositories/staff/in-memory-staff.repository.ts`, `src/test/repositories/platform/in-memory-tenant.repository.ts` — accept the event bus and drain `clearDomainEvents()` in `save()`, mirroring production (reuse the same `drain-domain-events.ts` helper so the doubles can't drift). Unit specs wire `InMemoryXxxRepository` and `InMemoryEventBus` as two *unconnected* doubles (verified: `approve-booking.use-case.spec.ts`) — once this story deletes the use-case publish loops, nothing feeds `eventBus.published` unless the doubles drain. All 16 use-case unit specs asserting on `.published` then pass with unchanged assertions. ⚠️ If those specs are red mid-story, the fix is this drain wiring — **never delete the event assertions.**

**Modify — test infrastructure:**
- `routing-in-memory-event-bus.ts`: defer handler dispatch via `scheduleAfterCommit()` when a transaction is ambient (per §C1 it dispatches immediately otherwise). Without this, repos draining inside the tx would trigger synchronous handler runs mid-transaction — handlers on separate connections can't see the uncommitted write, and nested `txManager.run()` calls risk deadlock.
- ⚠️ **The deferral must compose with the BFS queue — the trickiest work in this story.** The deferred after-commit callback must *enqueue* into the existing BFS queue when a dispatch cycle is active, never dispatch directly — otherwise the ordering race BFS exists to prevent resurfaces: `TenantProvisioned` → staff handler's nested tx commits and would fire `StaffInvited` *before* the notification handler has seeded templates. Regression signal: the `staff-invitation` assertion in `booking-full-workflow.handler.integration.spec.ts` — if it goes red, the BFS composition is wrong; do not "fix" it by reordering handlers.
- Because §C1 flushes after-commit callbacks *before* `txManager.run()` returns, dispatch still completes before each HTTP response — integration specs' "everything dispatched when the HTTP call resolves" assumption holds unchanged. Update the two comments in `booking-full-workflow.handler.integration.spec.ts` (~L90, ~L280) that say "RoutingInMemoryEventBus is synchronous" → "dispatched after commit, before the HTTP call resolves".
- `in-memory-event-bus.ts`: no deferral needed for unit specs — `InMemoryTransactionManager` creates no ambient context, so `scheduleAfterCommit` falls through to immediate dispatch; add the deferral only if an integration app turns out to use this bus under a real transaction.
- Integration app helpers keep overriding `EVENT_BUS` with the routing bus (`useClass`, never `useExisting`) — flow tests bypass the outbox by design; outbox behavior is covered by S01's dedicated tests plus this story's crash tests below.

**Tests (these are TD08 AUD-003's executable spec — write first where practical):**
- Crash-between-commit-and-publish: with inline dispatch disabled, commit a booking approval → assert outbox row unpublished + no Pub/Sub message → run relay → exactly one message delivered.
- Inline publish failure (Pub/Sub double that throws) → use case still succeeds; row unpublished; sweep retries and delivers.
- Two concurrent relay attempts on the same row → exactly one Pub/Sub publish.
- **Full-topology test (one, new):** an integration app where `EVENT_BUS` is the real `OutboxEventBus` wrapping the routing bus as its inner adapter, driving one booking approval end-to-end: use case → outbox row → relay → dispatch → notification handler → email log. This is the only test that exercises the *production* pipeline shape (flow suites bypass the outbox; S01 tests it in isolation) — it catches envelope-serialization drift through the JSONB round-trip that neither covers.
- Regression: every flow integration suite (booking/staff/platform → notification/loyalty) passes with only the routing-bus deferral change.

**Docs (same PR, per §7 DoD):** CLAUDE.md/§7 invariant + `docs/ENGINEERING_RULES.md` + `docs/03-DOMAIN_EVENTS.md` delivery-guarantees section + `docs/08-TESTING_STRATEGY.md` (routing-bus semantics changed).

**Acceptance:** grep proves no use case contains a `clearDomainEvents()` loop; `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter.publish` is referenced only by `OutboxRelayService`; full CI green.

> **State after S02:** all 21 sites flow through the outbox (jobs included, via the rebind, with `eventId`-fallback dedup keys). Dual-write is closed everywhere. Still open: cron double-run (needs S03's deterministic keys) and the §12.3 re-emit ordering (needs S03).

### TD24-S03 — Cron dedup keys + the loyalty re-emit (the two motivating bugs)

**Modify — events (4 classes):** `BookingReminderDue`, `BookingReminderDueToday`, `AdminDailyScheduleReminder`, `PointsExpiringSoon` — accept/derive a deterministic `dedupKey` per §Design table. Finalize the timezone-of-day rule during story discovery (candidate: the tenant's timezone for tenant-scoped reminders, `America/Sao_Paulo` default per §1).

**Modify — jobs (3 files, §A2):** construct events with dedup keys; wrap each job's per-tenant publish batch in `txManager.run()` so a run's outbox rows commit atomically (one tx per tenant-batch, not one giant tx — a mid-run crash then retries only the un-committed tenants' facts as no-op conflicts + remainder).

**Modify — job unit specs (3 files):** the publishing jobs gain a `txManager` constructor dependency — wire the existing `src/test/infrastructure/in-memory-transaction-manager.ts` double (it runs the work directly with no ambient context, so `InMemoryEventBus.publish` still records immediately; `expire-points.job.spec.ts` shows the pattern). Assertions on `.published` are otherwise unchanged.

**Modify — loyalty re-emit (1 file):** `complete-booking-loyalty-effects.use-case.ts` — move the `ServicePointsEarned` publish **inside** the existing `txManager.run()` that contains `markProcessed` (closes TD08 §12.3: the re-emit and the idempotency mark become one atomic fact).

**Tests:**
- Two overlapping runs of each job for the same business day → exactly one outbox row per business fact → one consumer effect (the M17-S03 acceptance test that `cron_run_log` failed).
- Mid-loop crash → re-run completes the remainder; no duplicates, no dropped facts.
- `BookingCompleted` redelivery after a simulated `ServicePointsEarned` outbox-write failure → effects roll back together and the redelivery completes both.

**Docs:** dedup-key recipe in `docs/ENGINEERING_RULES.md` ("adding a cron-published event"); update `plan/M17-CLOUD-DEPLOY.md` S03 note (the tracked fix now exists).

### TD24-S04 — Inbox consolidation (consumer side)

**Create:**
- Migration `CreateSharedInbox` — table per §Design; copy rows: `loyalty.processed_events` as-is; `notification.processed_events` with `consumer_name = notification_type || ':' || channel`; then `DROP` both old tables. Register in `integration-global-setup.ts`/`test-datasource.ts` same commit; **remove** the two dropped entities from both in the same commit.
- `shared/ports/inbox.port.ts` + `shared/infrastructure/entities/inbox-record.entity.ts` + `shared/infrastructure/typeorm-inbox.repository.ts` + in-memory double + builder.

**Modify:**
- loyalty: `complete-booking-loyalty-effects.use-case.ts` + `loyalty.module.ts` switch to the shared port (consumer name value unchanged).
- notification: `base-notification.use-case.ts` + `base-booking-reminder-notification.use-case.ts` swap `processedEventRepo` for the shared inbox port with composed consumer names; the 13 `send-*` use cases + `notification.module.ts` follow (mostly constructor wiring).
- staff: add the inbox check + `markProcessed` (inside the existing tx) to `create-initial-manager.use-case.ts` + `staff.module.ts` wiring — closes the uncovered `TenantProvisioned` path.

**Delete:** `loyalty/application/ports/processed-event-repository.port.ts`, `loyalty/infrastructure/entities/processed-event.entity.ts`, `loyalty/infrastructure/repositories/typeorm-processed-event.repository.ts`, `notification/application/ports/processed-event-repository.port.ts`, `notification/infrastructure/entities/processed-event.entity.ts`, `notification/infrastructure/repositories/typeorm-processed-event.repository.ts`, both in-memory doubles (`src/test/infrastructure/in-memory-processed-event.repository.ts`, `src/test/repositories/notification/in-memory-processed-event.repository.ts`), both builders (`src/test/builders/loyalty/processed-event-entity.builder.ts` + its `index.ts` export, `src/test/builders/notification/notification-processed-event-entity.builder.ts`); update `loyalty-integration-app.ts` / `notification-integration-app.ts` overrides. **Then grep `ProcessedEventEntity` and `NotificationProcessedEventEntity` across all `*.spec.ts` and `src/test/utils/**`** — specs embed the dropped entities in their `extraEntities` arrays (e.g. `booking-full-workflow.handler.integration.spec.ts` L25/L44) and must swap in the shared inbox entity; the delete list above is not the full blast radius.

**Modify — relay GC:** extend the sweep tick's GC with the inbox batched delete (D8; SQL in §Design) + `INBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` config with its ≥ 8 startup check. Also update the relay's GC tests.

**Tests:** duplicate `eventId` redelivery → single effect per consumer (loyalty, notification per template×channel, staff); migration copies existing dedup rows correctly (integration); inbox GC deletes only rows older than `INBOX_RETENTION_DAYS`; startup fails on `INBOX_RETENTION_DAYS < 8`.

**Docs:** `docs/13-DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` (both new tables, both drops); `docs/06-TENANT_ISOLATION_STRATEGY.md` — documented exemption: outbox/inbox are transport infrastructure keyed by `eventId`, not tenant-first business tables (outbox still carries `tenant_id` for observability). Include one LGPD data-inventory line: `outbox.payload` persists full event envelopes (customer names, emails, phones) in Postgres for `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` (14 days) — not a new *class* of exposure (Pub/Sub already retains the same data up to 7 days), but a new *store* that belongs in the inventory.

---

### TD24-S05 — Observability, docs closure, backlog cross-off

- Metrics/logs: unpublished-row count + oldest-unpublished age (the queue-lag signal), relay publish failures, GC deletions; OTel span attrs carry `tenant.id`/`correlation.id` from the envelope (§2 invariant 8). Wire an alert on oldest-unpublished age > 3 sweep intervals into the M17 alerting story if available.
- Doc sweep completion check (stale-doc rule, §7 DoD): confirm every item in §Doc updates landed in its owning story; sweep `docs/*.md` + `plan/*_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS_IA.md` for any remaining description of the old publish-after-commit flow.
- `td/TD08-AUDIT-REMEDIATION-BACKLOG.md`: AUD-001 done; AUD-003 covered by S02/S03 tests (link them); AUD-004 re-scoped (largely absorbed by D5/D7); AUD-018 (ordering keys) remains open, now unblocked.
- `docs/11-ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/05-BOUNDED_CONTEXTS.md`: outbox/inbox as shared transport infrastructure (explicitly *not* a bounded context; same category as Pub/Sub).

## Doc updates required (owned by the story making each change — not deferred to S05)

| Doc | Change | Story |

## Non-Goals

- **No CDC/Debezium, no broker replacement** — this TD makes `IEventBus.publish()`'s implied contract (each business fact reaches consumers exactly-once *in effect*) actually hold on Pub/Sub; it does not abstract over brokers.
- **No Pub/Sub ordering keys** — TD08 AUD-018, separate follow-up (relay is `SKIP LOCKED`, out-of-order-safe like today).
- **No changes to the trigger channel** — cron ticks are not domain events; `publishTrigger`/`registerTrigger` and the `/cron/*` thin controllers keep bypassing the outbox by design.
- **No retrofit of `cron_run_log`-style coarse gates** — superseded entirely by `dedup_key`.
- **No transactional email** — the notification consumer's dispatch→log sequence still can't span SMTP; sent-then-crash-before-log remains a rare, accepted duplicate-email window. Unchanged semantics.
- **No consumer/handler restructuring** — all 16 event handlers and 4 trigger handlers keep their exact shape (handle → one use case → rethrow).

## Acceptance Criteria (TD-level)

- [ ] No application code calls Pub/Sub publish directly for domain events — `GcpPubSubEventBusAdapter.publish` is referenced only by `OutboxRelayService`; `EVENT_BUS` resolves to `OutboxEventBus`.
- [ ] The 3 event-emitting aggregates' repositories drain domain events inside the save transaction; no use case contains a `clearDomainEvents()` publish loop (grep-verifiable).
- [ ] A test proves: crash between commit and publish loses nothing (sweep delivers exactly one message).
- [ ] A test proves: two concurrent publishes of the same business fact (same `dedup_key`) reach consumers as exactly one effect.
- [ ] A test proves: `ServicePointsEarned` survives a failed publish + `BookingCompleted` redelivery.
- [ ] `shared.inbox` is the only consumer dedup mechanism; both `processed_events` tables and all their ports/entities/repos/doubles/builders are gone; staff `TenantProvisioned` covered.
- [ ] Relay schedule is a Terraform variable; batch/grace/inline-toggle/retentions are env vars (both retentions default 14 days; inbox startup check enforces ≥ 8); sweep GC enforces retention on both tables via batched trickle-deletes — no partitioning (D10).
- [ ] Outbox lag observable (unpublished count + oldest-unpublished age) with an alert path.
- [ ] All doc-sweep items landed in their owning stories (§Doc updates table).
